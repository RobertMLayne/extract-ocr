 Notice regarding legal use of downloaded reference data

 EndNote gives you the capability to import references from online databases and store them in your
 personal EndNote libraries. Some producers of online reference databases expressly prohibit such use and
 storage of their data; others charge an extra fee for a license to use the data in this way. Before you
 download references from a database, be sure to check the copyright and fair use notices for the database.
 Note that different databases from the same provider may have varying restrictions.

Overview of Clarivate EndNote
  Welcome to EndNote—the complete reference solution!


What Is EndNote?
  EndNote is a bibliography maker.

  Cite While You Write allows you to format references in Microsoft Word, Google Docs, Apache OpenOffice
  Writer 3.x or 4.x, and LibreOffice 4.x–7.x (32-bit) for Windows. You can also create bibliographies for other
  word processors using Format Paper (RTF files). There is no better tool than EndNote for handling diverse
  bibliographic style requirements.

  EndNote is an online search tool.

  Search online bibliographic resources and retrieve references directly into your EndNote library. You can
  also export references to EndNote from your favorite online resource. See Direct Export Providers for more
  information about this feature.

  EndNote is a reference and full-text organizer with a collaborative Web tool.

  Your personal reference library will save you countless hours of organizing your research.

       ▪ Group references according to your research projects and attach up to 45 files per record for
          managing related materials.

       ▪ Locate full-text PDF files or create a reference when importing a PDF file.

       ▪ Synchronize references and file attachments with your EndNote Web library.

       ▪ Share groups with other EndNote users easily.
  EndNote desktop and EndNote Web/Online are collaborative tools to simplify working with colleagues. (At
  the time of this writing, the sharing feature is not yet available in EndNote Web and will revert to using
  EndNote online.)

EndNote Libraries and References
 This section covers creating and working with EndNote libraries and references. Here you will learn how to
 create an EndNote library, add references to it, and then search, edit, and share those references. In later
 sections you will learn how to create documents using the references in your library and how to customize
 EndNote to meet special requirements.




     Page 7 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide




The EndNote Library
   Your EndNote Library is a database for tracking all of your references and information about them. It's
   flexible, searchable, and can be used to create formatted bibliographies. You can store related files, such as
   PDFs and graphic files. If you work with colleagues, you can share your EndNote libraries with them.


The Library Window
   When you first open a Library in EndNote, you see a Library window made up of four panels.




     The Library Window

      1. The Groups, Group Sets, and Tags Panel

      2. The Reference List Panel

      3. The Search Panel (see Searching EndNote References)

      4. The Reference Panel

   You can click on a panel to make it active.


The Library Toolbar
   The Library toolbar provides various commands that allow you to manage your references.




   The commands on the Library toolbar include (from left to right):

       Page 8 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   Insert Citation: This command will insert the selected references into a word-processing document at the
   location of the cursor in Word.

   New Reference: Creates a new reference for data entry.

   Share This Group: Allows you to share the selected group through EndNote Web.

   Export: Exports references in a format that can be imported into another library or application.

   Find Full Text: Searches online for the full-text article for the selected references. EndNote downloads the
   file of the article and displays a paper clip in the Attachments (Paper Clip) column.

   Create a Web of Science Citation Report: Creates a citation report providing aggregate citation statistics
   for the selected reference(s). (This feature requires a Web of Science subscription.)


Resizing the Library Window
   Resize the Library window by clicking the window border in the lower right window corner of the library and
   dragging to the desired size or by clicking the maximize/minimize buttons in the upper corner of the Library
   window.

   EndNote remembers the new size of the Library window as well as its location on the screen. The next time
   you open EndNote, the library appears with the same dimensions and in the same location as when you last
   closed it. Each EndNote library can have its own unique dimensions and screen location.


Tabs in the Library
   The tabbed interface allows you to work with multiple groups or references in the library. The tab will show
   the name of the group selected for that tab. Select the New Tab button (the + button) above the Search
   panel to open a new tab in the library, then select the group you want to work with.


Changing the Library Display Font Size
   EndNote displays the recommended system font specified for your operating system.

   Select a different size for the text displayed in the Library by using EndNote’s preferences. The Reference
   List and the Reference panel displays both use the font size selected in the Display Font section of
   the preferences.

   See Display Font Preferences.

    Note: Changing the display font size does not affect the font EndNote uses when it creates a
    bibliography. EndNote uses the Normal style font of your paper for the bibliography.


The Groups Panel
   The left panel of the Library window displays the groups group sets, and reference tags available in your
   library and is generally referred to as the Groups panel.

   Groups are subsets of references saved for easy retrieval. The left panel of the Library window lists several
   group sets that include various types of groups: automatic groups (which EndNote creates and the user



       Page 9 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   cannot control), custom groups, smart groups, Groups Shared by Others, Find Full Text, Online Search, and
   Tags groups. See The Groups, Group Sets, and Tags Panel section for more information.


The Reference List Panel
   The Reference List displays all the references in the currently selected group. Options are available from the
   References and Library menus, and from the Library Window toolbar. See The Library Toolbar.

Changing the Display Fields

   By default, the first column in the Library window displays a File Attachment indicator followed by:

       ▪ Author
       ▪ Year
       ▪ Title
       ▪ Journal
       ▪ Last Updated
       ▪ Reference Type

   Reorder the fields in the Library window heading columns using drag and drop. Select a field heading and
   move it to the desired location in the column headings. For example, you can move the Last Updated field to
   be the last field or the first field in the heading column. Your changes are reflected in the Display Fields
   preference dialog.

   Customize which columns/fields display in the Library reference list by right-clicking on the column headings
   to display a contextual menu. Select or remove fields.

Changing the Order of the Display Fields or Adding/Removing Display Fields

   You can change the order of the fields, add fields, remove fields, or change the name of a field in the column
   headings of the Library window. See Display Fields Preferences for more information.

      1. From the Edit menu, select Preferences.

      2. Click the Display Fields option in the list.

      3. Select the desired field from the Field list. You may select up to ten fields to be displayed in the
         Library window. Select [Do not display] instead of a field name if you want to show fewer than ten
         fields.

      4. By default, the column heading in the Library window is the same as the Generic name of the field
         (the Figure field is indicated by a figure icon and the File Attachments field is indicated by a paper
         clip icon). To change the field name for the Reference List display, enter a new name in the Heading
         section next to the chosen field.

      5. To display all author names under the Author heading in the Reference List, select the checkbox next
         to the Display all authors in the Author field. Leave this box unchecked if you only want to see the
         last name of the first author in the column.

      6. Click OK to save your changes and to close the Preferences dialog.




       Page 10 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


    Note: These settings apply to all libraries.

   See also Display Fields Preferences.

Changing the Reference List Sort Order

   By default, the references listed in the Library window are sorted by the first author’s last name.

   Change the sort order by selecting Sort Library from the Library menu or by clicking the column headings.
   When you sort a library, that sort order is retained even after you close and reopen a library. See Sorting the
   Library for more information about sorting.

   When you sort the library, character sorting is carried out according to the language and local settings of
   your operating system—unless you specify a different language in the Sort Options dialog. This determines
   whether a plain "a" is sorted before or after "ä."

   EndNote does not remember the sort order for all groups. EndNote displays the results of a search in the
   order in which they are found. Similarly, after importing references, EndNote displays the newly imported
   references in the order in which they were imported. This behavior greatly enhances the speed of these two
   functions. Selecting the Show All References group shows all references in the Library window and lists
   them according to the last sort order specified.

    Note: See Sort Order: Bibliographies and Multiple Citations about how to set the sort order for a
    bibliographic style. See Sorting Preferences for information about having EndNote ignore certain words or
    names when sorting references.


Navigating in the Reference List

   There are a number of ways to browse through your references.

       ▪ Scroll through the list of references in the Reference List by clicking in the vertical scroll bar with the
          mouse.

       ▪ Use the Up and Down arrow keys to move up or down the reference list.

       ▪ Sort references in the list by clicking on a column heading. For example, click the Year heading to
          sort the references by descending or ascending year.

       ▪ Type a letter to select the first matching reference. Matching depends on the order in which the
          library is sorted. If the library is sorted by the Author field, typing a letter selects the first reference in
          which the first author’s last name begins with that letter.

          For example, typing the letter "Z" selects the Zorina reference in the sample library since Zorina is
          the first author’s name to begin with a "Z." Type several letters and the selection jumps to the first
          name that begins with those typed letters. Letter matching starts over after a half-second pause.

       ▪ On extended keyboards, the Home and End keys go to the first or last reference, respectively. The
          Page Up and Page Down keys allow you to move up or down the reference list.


The Search Panel
   The Search panel allows you to search your EndNote library, and is also used for searching online
   databases from EndNote.

       Page 11 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


  The Simple Search option displays a single line where you can enter a search term and search all fields.

  Click on Advanced search to display multiple search lines. With this option you can create advanced
  searches by selecting each field you want to search and entering the terms you want to search for in that
  field.

  To begin a search of your EndNote library, select the search option, then select the group of references you
  want to search. To search your whole library, select the All References group. Enter your search term(s) and
  press the Enter key on your keyboard to see the list of found references.

  To begin a search of an online database, click on the database name in the Groups panel under Online
  Search or go to the Tools menu and select Online Search. See Searching Online Databases for more
  information.


The Reference Panel
  The Reference panel displays the contents of a reference, allows editing of the reference, and viewing and
  annotation of PDFs. Each part of the reference is stored in its own field; field names and data can be seen
  in the Edit panel. The Reference Type field displays the type of reference that you are viewing, such as
  journal article, book, or conference proceeding. Changing the Reference Type field will change the names of
  the fields displayed.

  The first author’s last name, the year, and the EndNote record number appear at the top of the Reference
  panel in the title bar.

   Note: Record numbers should not be considered permanent identifiers. The same record may have a
   different number if it is copied to another library or synced to another computer. See Record Numbers for
   more information.


Reference Panel Options
  When you select a reference in the library, by default EndNote displays the Summary panel, showing a
  summary of the reference and a preview of the reference. The preview subpanel may only be displayed as a
  toolbar at the bottom of the panel, but you can drag it up to see both the summary and preview in the panel.

  To edit the reference, select Edit in the Reference panel.

  To see PDFs for the reference, select PDF in the Reference panel.

  If you change the Reference panel option, your choice will be remembered when you next start EndNote. So
  if you select the Edit option in the Reference panel, then close EndNote, the Edit panel will be displayed the
  next time you open EndNote.


Reference Panel Controls

      ▪ To open a context-sensitive menu, right-click anywhere in the Reference panel.

      ▪ Press Ctrl+Alt+A to attach a file to the current reference.

      ▪ To open a PDF in the default PDF application on your computer, in the Edit panel click the drop-down
         arrow for the PDF, then select the option to Open with… (the name of the application to open the
         PDF with will depend on the default PDF application for your computer).



      Page 12 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      ▪ Click the Attach File button in the Summary panel to attach a file such as a PDF, document, or text
         file.

  See The Reference Panel for more detailed information about the Reference panel.


Important Points About Libraries
  Listed below are some important points about the EndNote library.

      ▪ You can create up to 999,995 references in an EndNote library. However, it is recommended that the
         number not exceed 50,000 to maintain efficient database performance.

      ▪ There is no limit to the number of libraries you can create, assuming that you have the disk space to
         store them. We recommend that you keep all the references you cite in your papers in one primary
         library.

      ▪ You can select default libraries to open automatically when EndNote is started.

      ▪ You can open more than one library at a time.

      ▪ Libraries created with the Windows version of EndNote can be used by the macOS version of
         EndNote and vice versa (see Transferring Libraries between Computers or Platforms).

      ▪ Each library can be independently moved, copied, or deleted using the Windows Explorer. Always
         move, copy, or delete both the main .enl file and the .Data folder; otherwise, you can lose reference
         data.

      ▪ Figures, Groups, and other significant files are stored in a [library name].Data folder which is in the
         same folder as your main library file. This folder is an extension of the library, so remember to move,
         copy, or delete the associated .Data folder along with the main library file.

      ▪ Library filenames include the extension .enl. If your library filename does not include an .enl
         extension, Windows Explorer may not be displaying file extensions. You can change this setting in
         Windows Explorer if you wish.

      ▪ If you wish to rename a library, it is best to save a copy of the library with the new name, then use
         the copy you created instead of the original library. When you are sure the new library is working
         correctly, you can delete the original library.

      ▪ The Library window can be resized and the display font size can be changed.

      ▪ The Reference List displays a multi-column reference list. This list can be customized to meet your
         needs.

      ▪ The record number displayed in an EndNote record is not a permanent number. It will change if the
         record is copied between libraries, cut and pasted within the same library, or synchronized using
         EndNote Web/Online.

  Note: Changes made to the library you are syncing with EndNote Web/online can have consequences for
  your online library and any other EndNote libraries that are syncing to that online library. Do not move or
  rename libraries used with Sync. When syncing a library on a new computer, it is best to use an empty
  library to avoid creating duplicates of your references.




      Page 13 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   You can change the order of the fields, add fields, remove fields, or change the name of a field in the column
   headings of the Reference List display. See Display Fields Preferences for more information.


The Sync Feature
   Your purchase of EndNote desktop entitles you to a three-year free subscription to EndNote Web/online—
   our Web-based versions of EndNote. (At the time of this writing, EndNote online is transitioning to EndNote
   Web and the sharing feature is not yet available in EndNote Web.)

   The Sync feature allows you to synchronize the references (including file and figure attachments) in one
   EndNote desktop library with the references in your EndNote Web/Online library. You must register and
   have an active EndNote account to initiate the Sync process.

   The Sync feature provides an online backup of all your references and attachments for your current library,
   as well as providing access to your references from anywhere through EndNote Web/online.


Activating the Sync Process

I Already Have an EndNote Web/Online Account

      1. Click Configure Sync in the Groups panel to go to a Sync Configuration dialog. Click the Sync Now
         button to go to an EndNote Login dialog.

      2. Enter your EndNote account email address.

      3. Enter your EndNote account password.

      4. Click OK.

      5. Read the terms and conditions, then click Agree to accept the terms and conditions and to link your
         account to your new copy of EndNote.

      6. Click Sync to begin synchronizing your EndNote Web/online library with your EndNote library.

   Since you already have an EndNote account, EndNote populates the fields on the Sync Preferences page
   with the e-mail address and password that you entered on the EndNote Web/online login dialog. You can
   change the data in these fields if you ever change your email address or password in EndNote Web/online.

    Note: The Sync library that you defined in Sync Preferences must be open and currently active to perform
    the Sync process.


I Do Not Have an EndNote Web/Online Account

   Since you do not have an EndNote account, you must create one. Registration is fast and easy and
   activates your three-year EndNote account enhancement when completed.

      1. Click Configure Sync in the Groups panel to go to a Sync Configuration dialog.

      2. Click the Configure Sync button to go to an EndNote Login dialog.

      3. Click the Sign Up button to go to an EndNote Registration dialog.



       Page 14 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      4. Enter your email address in the EndNote Registration dialog. Retype your email address, and then
         click the Submit button.

      5. Enter your name and a secure password, read the EndNote End User License Agreement, then click
         the I Agree button if you wish to create your account.

      6. Click the Sync button to begin synchronizing your EndNote Web/online library with your EndNote
         library.

      7. Before synchronizing for the first time, you will be prompted to create a compressed library backup.
         Click the Yes button to create the backup.

      8. Choose the location for your backup, then click the Save button.

   EndNote will save the backup and begin synchronizing your library references.

   Once you create your EndNote account, EndNote populates the fields on the Sync Preferences page with
   the email address and password that you entered during registration. Later you can change the data in
   these fields if you ever change your email address or password in EndNote Web/online.

    Note: Although it is possible to synchronize your library without creating a compressed library backup
    during your first synchronization, we suggest creating the backup. You can also create a compressed
    backup of your library at any time. See Saving a Compressed Copy of a Library for more information.



Library Management
Back Up Your Libraries
   Your EndNote library becomes increasingly valuable to you as you add references to it. Consequently, it is
   imperative that you back up your libraries, along with any other important documents. Each library is made
   up of a file with the extension .enl plus a corresponding .Data folder. Always back up both the .enl file and
   the .Data folder.

   Use the Save a Copy command or one of the Compressed Library commands to save a copy of your library
   to a removable disk (or elsewhere) for safekeeping. See Backing Up Your EndNote Files for more
   information about making backup copies of your files. See Saving a Compressed Copy of a Library
   and Saving a Copy of a Library for ways to back up your library.


Saving a Copy of a Library
   EndNote automatically saves changes to your library as you work with it, so there is no Save or Save As
   command for the library. You can, however, use the Save a Copy command to create an exact copy of your
   library.

   To create a copy of your library:

      1. With a library open, select Save a Copy from the File menu.

      2. Name the new library and choose where to save it.

      3. Click Save and EndNote creates a copy of the library.



       Page 15 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   The new library does not open, it is saved to disk, where you can then open it with EndNote. EndNote
   leaves your original library open as it was before the command was chosen.

    Note: The Save a Copy command creates a [library name].enl file as well as a [library name].Data folder
    for the new library, and copies all necessary files and figures to it.


Saving a Compressed Copy of a Library
   The Sync Feature provides a backup of your EndNote library, but if you have deleted references from your
   library and emptied the trash, they will also be deleted from the online copy of the library; if you have deleted
   references from the online library and emptied the trash, they will be deleted from the EndNote library at the
   next sync. Making a backup of your library at regular intervals ensures you have access to older material, if
   you ever need it.

   You can save an EndNote library, including the filename.enl file, its associated .Data folder, and all of its
   contents, to a single compressed file in order to back up your library or to send a copy to a colleague. Later,
   you can restore the compressed library with EndNote.

    Note: EndNote libraries larger than 4 gigabytes or 65,535 files cannot be compressed with EndNote’s
    Compressed Library command. See Saving a Copy of a Library for information on making backup copies
    of larger libraries.


Creating a Compressed Library File

      1. Open the library in EndNote.

      2. From the File menu, select Compress Library (.enlx) to display a Compress Library dialog.

      3. Use the radio buttons to determine these options:

            ▪ Specify whether you want to Create a compressed library or to Create & Email the library.

            ▪ Specify whether you want to save file attachments with the library or not.

            ▪ Specify whether you want to save all references to the compressed library, only selected
               references, or only the references in a specific group or group set.

      4. Click Next to display a file dialog.

      5. Save the compressed library to a folder on your hard drive. You can change the file name but you
         cannot use the following characters.

             Invalid Characters for Naming
                 a Compressed Library
               \     back slash

               *     asterisk
               ?     question mark
               "     quotation mark



       Page 16 of 631

               >      greater than
               |      vertical bar

      5. If you selected the Create & Email option, EndNote will launch your default email application, create
         a new email, and attach the compressed library file to the email. Enter additional information to the
         email, such as a recipient, subject, and message. Click the Send button.

            Note: The Create & Email option will only work with desktop email applications. It will not work
            with online email sites. Emails attachment sizes may also be restricted by your email provider.


Restoring a Compressed Library File

   Use EndNote to open the filename.enlx file, which will extract the .enl file and the .Data folder to the same
   folder where the .enlx file is located.

   After restoring the compressed library, use EndNote to open the filename.enl file as you normally would to
   use the library.

    Note: Be careful not to open the compressed library in the same location as an original library of the same
    name. This would overwrite the original library's .enl file and .Data folder when the compressed library is
    uncompressed.


The Library Status
   To see a summary of statistics about the currently open library, go to the Library menu and select Library
   Status or click the Library Status button in the Groups panel.

   If you wish to save and print this information, select the text you want to copy, and then paste the text into a
   word processor document.

   See Library Status Dialog for more information.

   For a list of statistics about a specific reference, see the Reference Summary.


Setting a Favorite Library
   EndNote allows you to specify the libraries that you want to open automatically when EndNote starts up. We
   call these the "favorite" libraries.

   You do not need to select a favorite library. By default, EndNote will open the last used library.

   To assign or change the favorite library:

      1. Open the library (or libraries) that you would like to set as your favorite(s). You must have a library
         open in order to set it as your favorite library.

      2. From the Edit menu, select Preferences, and then select Libraries.



       Page 17 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      3. In the drop-down list at the top of the window, select Open the specified libraries.

      4. Click Add Open Libraries and all of the currently open libraries will be added to the list of favorite
         libraries that should open every time EndNote starts.

      5. Click OK to save your changes and close the Preferences dialog.

   To remove a library from the list of favorite libraries:

      1. From the Edit menu, select Preferences and select Libraries from the list of options.

      2. Select the library that you would like to remove from the list of favorite libraries and click Remove
         Library. (This will only remove the library from your favorites list, it will not delete the library.)

      3. Click OK to save your changes and close the Preferences dialog.


Opening a Library
   To open a library when the EndNote program is already running, select Open from the File menu and select
   Open Library. If you have previously opened a library, you can use the Open Recent list to open a recently
   opened library and skip the dialog below.

   When you select the Open Library command, EndNote displays a file dialog.

   By default, this dialog displays all files with an extension .enl, .enlx, .enlp, or .lib. (.lib was the extension for
   very early versions of EndNote.) If your library name has a different extension, you should change the Files
   of Type option to All files (*.*). If your library is listed in the dialog, select it and click Open. If your library is
   not listed there, then it is probably saved in a different place on your hard drive or removable disk.

   To locate a library not on the list, use your operating system's search feature to look for files ending
   in .enl, .enlp, or .enlx. Note the location of the file, then use the File > Open Library command in EndNote to
   locate and open the file.

   When you open a compressed library (with the extension .enlx), EndNote uncompresses the files and opens
   the uncompressed version (with the extension .enl). After uncompressing a library, you should open the .enl
   file, not the .enlx file.


Closing a Library
   To close a library, do one of the following:

       ▪ From the File menu, select Close Library.

       ▪ Type Ctrl+W when the Library window is active.

       ▪ Click the Close button in the top right corner of the Library window.

       ▪ Type Ctrl+Shift+W to close all open libraries.
   EndNote saves changes to references in your library as you work. As a result, closing the library does not
   invoke the familiar "Save changes?" question unless changes to a reference you were working in have
   not been saved. EndNote will ask if you want to save changes to the open reference, but not changes to the
   library as a whole.



       Page 18 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   Closing the only open library will quit the EndNote program. If you want to quit from EndNote, select Exit
   from the File menu or type Ctrl-Q . Exit from the File menu and any open libraries are saved and closed
   automatically.


Deleting a Library
   You can delete an EndNote library in one of two ways.

   One option is to exit EndNote and delete the library file and its associated .Data folder by dragging the icons
   to the Recycle Bin.

   The other option is to delete a library from within EndNote.

      1. Close the library, but keep EndNote open.

      2. From the File menu, select Open and then Open Library.

      3. In the file dialog, select the libraryname.enl file, right-click and select Delete from the menu.

      4. Next, highlight the libraryname.Data folder, right-click and select Delete from the menu.

      5. Click Cancel to close the file dialog.


Moving a Library
   Each EndNote library can be independently moved using the File Explorer. When moving a library, we
   recommend that you move both the main .enl file and the .Data folder.

   If you move an .enl file without moving the corresponding .Data folder, EndNote will try to recreate the .Data
   folder to accompany the .enl file the next time you try to open the .enl file. However, you may lose data,
   including PDF file attachments, term lists, and even reference information.

   EndNote will display an Alert when you try to open the .enl file without the corresponding .Data folder that
   includes the text below:

    You are attempting to open an EndNote Library without its associated .Data Folder. This is not
    recommended because it may result in the loss of data including, but not limited to: reference information,
    file attachments, and term lists.

    In order to prevent the loss of data you should locate the original .Data folder and copy it to the same
    location as the EndNote library you are attempting to open. The .Data folder was created in the same
    directory in which the EndNote library was originally created.

   We recommend that you click Cancel and go find and move your original .Data folder before attempting to
   open a moved library.

    Note: Please do not move or rename your EndNote library files after they are synchronized, as this will
    break the link to the Sync target library.

Recovering a Damaged Library
   If an EndNote library has been damaged, you may get an error message like the one below when trying to
   open it or work with the references. If you have been syncing the library with EndNote Web/online, click the
   Sync button and EndNote will attempt to repair your library from the copy saved online.




   If you have not synced the library, you may be able to use the Recover Library… command under the
   Library menu to repair the library.

   Along with syncing your library to be sure there is always a backup online, another good way to protect
   yourself from damaged files is to make regular backup copies of your important files and documents (see
   Backing Up Your EndNote Files, Saving a Compressed Copy of a Library, and Saving a Copy of a Library).
   If you are not syncing and do not have a backup copy of a damaged EndNote library, you can use the
   Recover Library command to repair the damaged file.

   To repair a damaged EndNote library:

      1. Close the library if it is currently open.

      2. From the Library menu, select Recover Library. Read the information about the Recover Library
         command, and click OK.

      3. In the dialog that appears, locate and select the library that needs to be repaired, and click Open.

   EndNote creates a copy of the library with the suffix "-Saved" added to the name. For example, if you were
   repairing a library called "References" the original library would remain untouched and a new, repaired
   library called "References-Saved" would be created in the same location.

   Once the new library has been saved, you should be able to open it and use it in place of the damaged
   library.

Differences Between Saved Libraries and the Original

   The purpose of the Recover Library command is to recover as many references from the original library as
   possible. This means that it may also recover references that had previously been deleted from the library,
   but not yet emptied from the Trash. If there are more references recovered in the saved library than existed
   at the time the original library was damaged, it means that EndNote was able to reconstruct references that
   had recently been deleted. These references must be deleted again.




       Page 20 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   Term lists are not recovered with the library. Consequently, you will need to rebuild each term list by
   selecting Define Term Lists from the Library menu, highlighting the list, and then clicking Update List to fill
   the term list with the terms used in your library. For the Journals term list, you may find it a better option to
   import one of the predefined term lists instead of using the Update List feature.

    Note: If you have problems recovering a damaged library, we suggest contacting EndNote support.


Find Broken Attachments Links
   Broken file attachment links occur when EndNote cannot locate the file in the path specified in the File
   Attachment field. In these instances, EndNote cannot display or index the attached file or include the file
   when compressing a library.

   To find broken file attachments in the currently open library, go to the Library menu and select Find Broken
   Attachment Links.

   EndNote finds all references with broken file attachment links and displays them in the Library window. In
   the Groups panel, EndNote creates a new group called Broken Attachments.

   This situation may occur when you:

       ▪ Open a library that has one or more broken file and figure links.

       ▪ Import a library that has one or more broken file and figure links.

       ▪ Open a library without the accompanying .Data folder that contains the PDF files.

       ▪ Transfer PDFs and figure files using the Sync function and EndNote finds one or more broken file
          and figure links.

Fix or Remove Broken Attachment Links

   To fix broken links, delete the link for the broken attachment and reattach the original file.

   To remove broken attachment links, select Remove Broken Attachment Links from the Library menu.
   Removing broken links using this command cannot be undone, so you may want to create a backup of your
   library first. See Saving a Compressed Copy of a Library and Saving a Copy of a Library for methods of
   backing up your library.


Sorting the Library
   The Sort Library command provides a way to arrange all references showing in the Reference List for
   browsing, exporting, printing, or copying.

   By default, the references in the list are automatically sorted by the first author’s last name.

   You can change the sort order by selecting Sort Library… from the Library menu or by clicking the column
   headings. When you sort a library, the sort order is retained even after you close and reopen a library.

   To change the sort order:

      1. From the Library menu, select Sort Library…



       Page 21 of 631
         Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


         2. Select one or more field names from the menus. Enter the field names in the order you want the
            references sorted. You do not have to use all five options.

         3. Click the button to the right of each field to indicate ascending or descending order.

         4. Click OK.

    The Sort Options dialog is initially set to sort the library by author names, in alphabetical order, and then
    references published by the same author are sorted by year (from oldest to newest).

     Note: EndNote reads the default language setting from your operating system and uses it as the default
     language for character sorting. However, you can override the default language from this dialog.


Special Cases in Sorting

    Except for title fields, quotation marks, parentheses, and other punctuation marks are considered during a
    sort. In an alphabetic sort, punctuation comes first, then numbers, then letters A-Z.

    If the field you selected to sort by is empty in a particular reference, or not included in the selected reference
    type, that reference will sort before the other references in ascending order.

Author Names

    When you select the Author field for sorting, author names from the first Author field are sorted by last name
    first, then first initial. Next, author names from the Secondary Author field are compared for sorting. Then,
    author names from the Tertiary Author field are compared for sorting.

    If a reference has more than one author in a single field, EndNote includes the additional authors in the sort
    (up to 255 characters) before moving on to other fields.

    If you select the specific First Author field to sort, only the surname is used for sorting.

    If your EndNote library includes author names with connectives such as de, di, van, and von, you may want
    EndNote to skip these parts of the name in order to sort the references by the principal element of the
    surname. See Sorting Preferences.

Titles

    When sorting by title fields, EndNote ignores the words A, An, and The as well as punctuation at the start of
    the titles. You may enter additional words that should be ignored for sorting purposes when they appear at
    the beginning of a title. To do so, see Sorting Preferences.

Sorting Diacritical Characters

    Characters with diacritics are sorted differently in English, Spanish, Swedish, and other languages. EndNote
    reads the default language (or locale) setting from your operating system and uses it as the default
    language for sorting. EndNote typically sorts diacritical characters according to the rules of the language
    selected for your operating system; however, you can override the default language setting on the Sort
    Options dialog.

Creating a New Library
  Although you can create as many libraries as you like, we strongly recommend that you keep all of your
  references together in one main EndNote library. Having all of the references you need in one place avoids
  unnecessary complexity when you are writing papers, creating bibliographies, or moving files between
  computers. Instead of making different "specialty" libraries, you will find it more useful to create one library
  and use Groups to help you organize and categorize your references. You can also use the Keywords and
  Label fields to assign terms to references, and easily assign them to a smart group or find them with
  EndNote’s Search and Sort References commands.

  To create a library:

     1. From the File menu, select New.

     2. EndNote presents a dialog prompting you to name and save the new library.

     3. By default, EndNote will call the new library "My EndNote Library," but you can change the name.
        Enter a name for your new library. Using a unique name for your library will make it easier to identify
        if you ever have to work with multiple libraries, or with libraries others have given to you. Do not
        include an extension, EndNote will add the ".enl" extension for the main library file and the ".Data"
        extension for the linked Data folder automatically.

     4. Select the location where you would like to save the library. For simplicity, we suggest that you save
        your EndNote libraries in your Documents folder.

     5. Click Save and the new library appears as an empty EndNote library.

   Note: Do not save EndNote libraries in any cloud-syncing folders or drives. Cloud-syncing programs can
   corrupt EndNote libraries over time. The only suggested method for syncing EndNote libraries is through
   EndNote Web/Online.

  Now that you have created a new library, you can begin entering references into it. The following topics
  illustrate the different ways to add references to an EndNote library:

      ▪ Creating a New Reference discusses how to enter individual references manually.

      ▪ How to Search an Online Database describes how to connect directly to online databases and
         retrieve references from them.

      ▪ Importing Reference Data into EndNote shows you how to import references that you have
         previously downloaded from online bibliographic databases.

  If you have just created the library that will be the main library you use, you can set it to open automatically
  every time you start EndNote by setting it to be your "favorite library" (see Setting a Favorite Library).


Merging Libraries
  There are two ways to merge complete libraries: Merging Libraries through Sync or Importing EndNote
  Libraries to import one library into another. (For information on copying selected references from one library
  to another, see Copying and Pasting Complete References.)




      Page 23 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


  Any time you add references to a library, the newly added references are assigned new record numbers in
  the order that they are added to the library. This means that a reference that was #23 in a smaller
  library could become #600 in a larger library.

   Note: Before merging libraries, we strongly suggest making a backup copy of the library into which you
   are transferring references. See Saving a Compressed Copy of a Library and Saving a Copy of a Library
   for information on creating a backup.


Merging Libraries through Sync
  If you sync a new EndNote library to an EndNote Web/Online account that contains references in it, the
  references will be merged together into a single library, and the last library you synced to your EndNote
  account will become the library you use for syncing from that time on. The advantage of this method of
  merging libraries is that all the references, group sets, and groups from both libraries will be included in the
  merged library. The disadvantage is that references that exist in both original libraries will be duplicated.

  Steps to merge two libraries together using Sync:

     1. If you have previously synced a library, close that library in EndNote, then proceed to step 3.

     2. If you have not previously synced a library, open the library you do not want to use for your final
        synced library in EndNote and follow the instructions in The Sync Feature to sync the library to your
        EndNote account. After syncing, close that library.

     3. (Optional) To identify which references were in each original library, before syncing you might find it
        helpful to create a custom group containing all the references in each library and labeling it with
        something like "All from [original library name]." The groups would need to be created before syncing
        any libraries, with all the references in a given library added to that group.

     4. Open the library you want to merge with the previously synced library. Please note this will be the
        library that you will sync in the future.

     5. Select Sync Status in the Groups panel. A message will be displayed saying, "You already have a
        synced library. If you choose to sync this library, it will be merged with your existing synced library..."

     6. Click the Sync Now button. A warning will appear saying, "Warning: You are about to sync or share a
        library that is different than the last library you synced. This will merge the libraries. Do you wish to
        proceed?" If you wish to merge the libraries, click the Yes button.

     7. You will be asked if you want to create a backup of the library. We suggest clicking Yes to create a
        backup before syncing. If you chose Yes to make a backup, save the backup and the sync process
        will begin; if you chose No, the sync process will begin immediately.

  When the sync has finished, you will see all the references, group sets, and groups that appeared in both
  original EndNote libraries. Be sure to use this library in the future for syncing.

   Note: If you had previously set another library as a favorite to open when starting EndNote, you may wish
   to make your merged library the favorite instead. You can find instructions for this in Choosing a Library to
   Open.




      Page 24 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


Importing EndNote Libraries
  The advantage of using the Import command to combine libraries is its ability to filter out duplicate
  references during the import operation.

   Note: Before merging libraries, it is a good idea to make a backup copy of the library into which you are
   transferring references. See Saving a Compressed Copy of a Library and Saving a Copy of a Library for
   information an making a backup.

  To import an EndNote library into an EndNote library:

     1. Open the library into which you want to import the references.

     2. From the File menu, select Import > File.

     3. Click the Choose button. Locate and select the library you want to import, then click the Open button.

     4. From the Import Options, select EndNote Library.

     5. Select an option from the Duplicates list:

         ▪ Import All: Imports the references, including duplicates.

         ▪ Discard Duplicates: Imports the references, except duplicates.

         ▪ Import into Duplicates Library: Duplicate references are imported into a library called File-
             Dupl.enl, where "File" is the name of the library into which you are importing.

             By default, a reference is considered a duplicate when the Author, Year, Title, and Reference
             Type match a reference already in the library. See Duplicates Preferences if you would like to
             change the duplicates criteria.

     6. Set the Text Translation option to No Translation. Extended characters, saved as Unicode in
        EndNote, will transfer correctly.

     7. Click Import to import the file.

   Note: The time required to import an EndNote library is proportionate to the size of the library.

  When the import is complete, the library displays the contents of the Imported References temporary group.
  This is the time to add a keyword to each imported reference with the Change Fields command or to peruse
  the imported data to make sure it imported as expected. Make sure to check references that contain
  extended characters.


About Shared Libraries
  EndNote 2025 offers users the option to share your entire sync library with up to 1,000 other users.

  Library sharing provides entire teams with immediate and real-time access to an entire EndNote library,
  meaning the same set of references, attachments, notes, and annotations. Changes are sent and received
  via sync, so all members of the shared library need to have the desktop activated with sync preferences
  completed, and be connected to the internet in order to send and receive changes. Library sharing is


      Page 25 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   recommended as an alternative to saving a library on a shared drive, or emailing a compressed copy
   around to a group of collaborators.

    Notes: Libraries are synced approximately every 15 minutes, so members may not all see changes
    immediately after they are made.

   To begin sharing select Share… from the File menu.

   You will be presented with the Share Dialog, where invitations can be sent.

   The Share Dialog allows you to do the following:

       ▪ Invite people to have access to your Shared Library.

       ▪ Check the status of your invitations.

       ▪ Resend (remind) prior recipients of invitations.

       ▪ Add or change access level for colleagues invited to share your library.

       ▪ Remove colleagues from your Shared Library.
   To invite people to your shared library:

      1. Open your synced library.

      2. Select Share… from the File menu.

      3. If you are not logged into EndNote online, you will be prompted to log in.

      4. The Share dialog will pop up.

      5. Enter the email address (or addresses, separated by commas) of the people that you would like to
         invite in the box under Invite more people.

      6. For each invitee, use the Permission drop-down to select the desired access level: Read & Write or
         Read Only.

      7. If desired, enter an optional message in the Add a message box.

      8. Click the Invite button.

   Once users have accepted the Shared Library invitation, their activity in that library will be reflected in The
   Shared Library Activity Feed.

   You can remove or change a person's access to your library by clicking the Settings button (the gear) next
   to their name.


Being Invited to a Shared Library
   When you are invited to a Shared Library, you will receive an email.

   Click on the Accept button, and a browser window should appear.

    Note: Libraries shared with you will always show the email address for the owner's EndNote account as
    the name of the library. This library name cannot be changed.


The Shared Library Activity Feed
   The Shared Library Activity Feed provides Shared Library members with insight into who is doing what to
   the shared library, as well as when new members join.

   Each Shared Library comes with an Activity Feed, both the library you are sharing with others, and those
   libraries that others have shared with you. This feature has been available since EndNote X8.

   The Feed is attached to the associated Shared Library window. You can click on the Activity Feed drop-
   down button, to the right of the bell icon in the Sync Status, to display it, scroll through the updates listed
   and click outside the feed to dismiss it.




     Activity Feed Button

How is the activity displayed?

   Activity is presented in reverse chronological order, and the Feed will update to display all the new activity
   that has happened since you last synced changes to the Shared Library. Next to each sync span, you will
   see the sync icon with a sync timestamp and below it all the latest activity that was retrieved. The activity is
   displayed in this way to update you with all the latest activity since you were last working on the library.

What activity is reflected in the feed?

   All Shared Library member activity including:

       ▪ Activities: Adding, modifying, moving to or restoring from Trash, deleting (emptying Trash)

       ▪ Library objects: references, attachments and figures, Groups and Groups Sets.

       ▪ New member joining the library by accepting the invitation

       Page 27 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       ▪ When a user has performed an action more than 1 time, that activity is consolidated into one line.
          Example: adding 145 new references

       ▪ Exceptions are Groups (Smart, Combined, Custom) or Group Sets being created. These are listed
          out individually so a user can select that activity line and be taken to the Group or Group Set to
          display contents.

       ▪ The deletion of one or more Groups or Group Sets is consolidated to one line. The user can select
          that activity line and see the deleted Group or Group Set names listed out on individual lines.

       ▪ What is considered a "modification" of a Smart or Combined Group: 1) New search criteria or group
          being added or taken away 2) Group is renamed 3) moved to new Group Set

Which activity lines are active versus inactive?

   Items listed in the feed are distinguished as active vs. inactive by the font color. Inactive lines, such as a
   member joining the Shared Library, are a light shade of gray, indicating to the user that they are unable to
   select that line.

   Activity lines not in light gray are meant to signify that they will show more information. For example,
   selecting a line that says “Bob Smith added 145 references” will display those 145 references that Bob
   Smith added in a temporary Activity Feed group. Selecting a line that says “Bob Smith created a new Smart
   Group” will cause that Smart Group to be highlighted in the Groups pane and its reference contents to
   display in the library view.

What activity is not in the Shared Library Activity Feed?

   Members being invited or revoked will not be reflected in the feed, it is only when a user has joined by
   accepting the invitation. Also excluded is activity done by the library owner in the EndNote online
   environment, though activity done by the owner on an iPad/iPhone will be reflected.

   If the owner has shared individual groups instead of sharing the whole library, changes made by those
   sharing the individual groups will not be included in the activity feed.

What happens when I select a line of activity and some content has since been deleted?

   If you select a line of activity to which changes have since been made (e.g. “Bob Smith added 200
   references” but more recently, another member of the library, Mike Hammer, deleted 75 of those) you will be
   presented with the remaining references. You will be viewing the most up-to-date set of references and
   attachments.

Can I undo a line of activity?

   No. The Feed is meant to inform and does not offer the ability for users to roll back changes or access an
   earlier version of the Shared Library.


Multiple People Opening One Library
   It is possible to share a read-only copy of a library on a local area network (LAN) drive. However, keeping a
   read-write library on a network drive is strongly discouraged and can lead to library corruption. To avoid
   library corruption, keep the master library on the computer of the library administrator and put a read-
   only copy of the library on the network drive. If there is more than one administrator, the administrators
   should share access to the library through EndNote's Sync's Library Sharing, not by trying to update the


       Page 28 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


  library on a network drive, then the "main" administrator should put the copy on the network drive, to keep
  the record numbers consistent (record numbers change with sync). See The EndNote Library is
  Corrupted, Record Numbers, and About Shared Libraries.

  EndNote does not perform record-locking functions that would allow multiple users to edit one library at the
  same time. However, multiple users can access one EndNote library simultaneously as long as the library is
  restricted to read-only or locked status. This will allow users to perform searches, copy information to their
  documents, and format their papers. Use File Explorer to change the Properties of your EndNote library;
  select the Read-Only attribute for the .enl file and the .Data folder.

  The simplest way to set up an EndNote library for shared network access is to use the network’s system of
  file permissions to control the type of access allowed for users and groups. Except for the person who posts
  the database, grant all users read-only access.

  One person should be assigned the responsibility for maintaining and updating the library on their computer,
  not on the network. This user should be granted full access to the file and should periodically post an
  updated copy of the library on the network for all other users, with read-only access.


Converting a Reference Manager Database to EndNote
  EndNote can easily convert Reference Manager databases to EndNote databases. The original Reference
  Manager database is left intact while references are copied and converted.

   Note: This feature is available to users of Reference Manager, versions 11 and 12.

  While every effort has been made to map Reference Manager reference types to corresponding EndNote
  reference types and Reference Manager fields to corresponding EndNote fields, you may want to make
  some adjustments by using the Field Mapping tool during the conversion process. Alternatively, you can
  make changes to reference types in a Reference Manager database before converting the database to
  EndNote.

  To convert a Reference Manager database to an EndNote library:

     1. From the File menu, select Open > Open Library to display a Select a Reference Library dialog.

     2. At the bottom of the dialog, select Reference Manager Databases (*.RMD) from the Files of
        type menu.

     3. Use the file dialog to navigate to the folder that contains the Reference Manager database that you
        want to convert to EndNote. Highlight the database name, and then click the Open button.

     4. A "Convert Reference Manager Database" dialog will appear that lets you know that the database
        must be converted for use. You can either:

         ▪ Click Convert to proceed with the conversion. This option allows EndNote to automatically
            convert Reference Manager reference types and fields to EndNote. It also leaves all file
            attachments stored in Reference Manager references in their original location.

         ▪ Click Customize if you want to modify the mapping of individual Reference Manager reference
            types to EndNote reference types and Reference Manager fields to EndNote fields. This option is
            useful if you have created customized reference types in Reference Manager.

            Use the top panel of the dialog to map each reference type to a corresponding EndNote
            reference type. When you highlight a setting in the top panel of the dialog, you can change the

      Page 29 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


              field mapping for that reference type in the bottom panel of the dialog. Click OK to save changes
              to the mapping. See Mapping Reference Manager Reference Types and Fields to EndNote for a
              list of reference types.

              Click the Reset to Default Map button if you want to discard your changes and return to the
              default mapping set.

              Click OK to save your changes when you are finished using the Field Mapping tool.

      5. Click the Convert button if you do not have any additional changes to make.

      6. On the "Save Converted Library as" dialog, give the new EndNote library a name (the default file
         name is the same as the old Reference Manager file name).

   After the conversion completes, EndNote displays a "Convert Reference Manager Database" dialog. Click
   Yes if you want to convert your file attachments to relative links, which will put them in the .Data folder for
   the library. Click No to retain your file attachments as absolute links in their original location.

    Note: Each EndNote library is made up of both an .enl file and a .Data folder. Each library can be
    independently moved, copied, or deleted after the conversion process. See Closing a Library for more
    information. Always move, copy, or delete both the main .enl file and the .Data folder; otherwise, you can
    lose reference data.


    Note: The Cancel button allows you to cancel the entire conversion process. The Reference Manager
    database is not converted and cannot be opened in EndNote.


Converting Absolute Links to Relative Links
   After the conversion completes, the new library opens in EndNote. All document and figure files appear in
   the File Attachments field within an EndNote reference. Move your cursor over a particular file to displays a
   tool tip that shows the full path (absolute path) of the file location. Files that show they are within the .Data
   folder for the library are relative links. This means the .Data folder can be moved with the .enl file and the
   links will continue to work, even if the library is moved to a different computer, or if the library is synced to
   another computer. Files that are not shown within the .Data folder to the library are absolute links and would
   become unavailable if the library were moved to a different computer, and would not be available on another
   computer if the library were synced.

   In EndNote, you can easily change an absolute path to a relative path for each reference within a library list.

      1. Select (highlight) each reference containing file attachments.

           Note: You can easily sort all records with file attachments by clicking the paper clip that appears in
           the Attachments (Paper Clip) column of the Library window.

      1. From the References menu, select File Attachments > Convert to Relative Links.

      2. Click OK when the message appears.

   The folder path for all attachments are quickly converted to relative links.

Converting Reference Manager Attachments to EndNote
  See Selecting a Relative Path or an Absolute Path for File Attachments for more information about absolute
  path versus relative path.


Mapping Reference Manager Reference Types and Fields to EndNote
  When you use EndNote to convert a Reference Manager database, Reference Manager reference types are
  mapped to EndNote reference types as shown in the table below. You can override these default settings
  when you convert the Reference Manager database.

  To change the field mapping during the Reference Manager to EndNote conversion:

     1. Click the Customize button when the dialog below appears.




     2. In the dialog show below you can set the reference types and fields you want your customized
        Reference Manager data to map to. From the top panel, select an EndNote reference type from the
        EndNote list, then select the fields you want mapped from the bottom panel.

Field Mapping Table

   As much as possible, Reference Manager fields are mapped to corresponding EndNote fields. You can
   override these default settings when you convert the Reference Manager database. From the bottom panel,
   select an EndNote field from the EndNote list.

   In some instances, the list of Reference Manager fields for a selected reference type may contain
   "dashes" (made up of multiple hyphens) that are mapped to the Notes field in the EndNote fields column.
   This occurs during the conversion when a Reference Manager field does not exist in the incoming reference
   type, and thus, appears as a dashed line in the Reference Manager Fields panel.

   These are the default values for both databases.

Special Field Mapping Conditions

   While the EndNote conversion tool allows you to make changes to most of the reference types and field
   mappings, there are some special mappings that you cannot modify. They include:

       ▪ The REF ID field in Reference Manager always maps to the Label field in EndNote.

       ▪ The End Page field in Reference Manager maps to the Pages or Section field in EndNote, depending
         on the reference type.

     Note: If the receiving field already contains data, then EndNote appends the End Page data with a
     preceding hyphen character in order to create ranges. For example: 123-128


       ▪ Any Reference Manager field that maps to the Date field in EndNote: For all reference types (except
         Conference Proceeding, Electronic Citation, Grant, and Patent), year data is copied to the Year field
         in EndNote.

       ▪ In the Conference Proceeding reference type, when the Reference Manager Pub Date [Date,
         Primary] field is mapped to the Year Published [Custom 2] field in EndNote, any year information is
         copied to the Year Published [Custom 2] field in EndNote and the complete field information is
         copied to Notes.

       ▪ In the Electronic Citation reference type, when the Reference Manager Last Updated [Date, Primary]
         field is mapped to the Epub Date [Section] field in EndNote, any year information is copied to the
         Year field in EndNote.

       ▪ In the Grant reference type, when Reference Manager Pub Date [Date, Primary] field is mapped to
         the Year field in EndNote, any year information is copied to Year and the complete field information is
         copied to Notes.

       ▪ In the Online Source reference type, when Reference Manager Access Date [Date Secondary] field
         is mapped to the Access Date [Number] field in EndNote, any year information is copied to the
         Access Year [Volume] field in EndNote.

       ▪ In the Patent reference type, when Reference Manager Date Issued [Date, Primary] field is mapped
         to the Issue Date [Custom 2] field in EndNote, any year information is copied to the Year field in
         EndNote.




      Page 36 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       ▪ For the Journal references in Reference Manager: If the Conference Title [Title, secondary] in
          Reference Manager contains data, the reference will not convert using typical Journal field
          mappings. EndNote maps as appropriate for a Conference Paper.

       ▪ For Thesis/Dissertation references in Reference Manager: If the Periodical field in Reference
          Manager contains data, the reference will not convert using typical Thesis/Dissertation reference
          type mappings. EndNote will use mappings similar to those for a Journal.


Opening and Converting Old EndNote Libraries
   When opening a library from a version of EndNote prior to EndNote X9.3, EndNote will convert the library to
   the current format and leave the original library unchanged. EndNote libraries consist of an .enl file and
   a .Data folder that must be kept together when sharing libraries.

   To open or convert an older EndNote library:

      1. Start EndNote.

      2. From the File menu, select Open and then Open Library.

      3. On the file dialog, locate and highlight the old library, and then click Open. EndNote will warn you
         that the selected library was created with an older version and ask you for permission to convert it.

      4. Click OK to convert the library.

      5. EndNote will give the new library a default name of [oldlibraryname]-Converted.enl, but you can
         change it. Name the new library and click Save.

   The conversion makes a copy of the original library in the latest file format, and leaves the original library
   intact.


Transferring Libraries between Computers or Platforms
   Any library created or updated with EndNote X9.3 can be used by EndNote X9.3 or later on Windows or
   macOS. No conversion is necessary. Therefore the methods described below can be used for transferring
   libraries between computers, no matter the platform.

   With EndNote X9.3 the database engine changed. This means EndNote X9.3 or later are able to open and
   use libraries from EndNote 2025, but EndNote 2025 libraries cannot be opened in EndNote X9.2 or earlier.


Transferring a Library through Sync
   The easiest way to transfer the contents of a library from one computer to another, whether Windows or
   macOS operating system, is to use EndNote Sync. This method will work even if not all of the libraries being
   synced are from the same version of EndNote.

      1. If you have not yet done so, sync the library on your original computer to EndNote Web/Online. You
         can find instructions in the section The Sync Feature.

      2. On the computer you are transferring your library to, create an empty library and sync it to the same
         EndNote account. The empty library will be populated with all the references, group sets, and groups
         from the original library (if you use a library with references in it, they will be merged and you may
         end up with duplicate references). Attachments that are in the .Data folder of the original library will

       Page 37 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


         also be transferred. These will be attachments created as relative links. See Selecting a Relative
         Path or an Absolute Path for File Attachments for more information on relative links.

     3. If automatic sync is turned off, be sure to manually sync the library before closing EndNote to update
        the online library.

   Note: EndNote record numbers are not permanent and may change during sync.

  The two copies of the library will continue to synchronize changes made to to the library on either computer.


Transferring a Compressed Library
  If you want to copy a library to another computer, or give a copy of it to a colleague, but do not want to
  synchronize your references, the safest way to do so is by creating a compressed copy of the library. A
  compressed copy can be transferred through a network, through syncing services such as OneDrive,
  iCloud, or Dropbox, or attached to an email (if small enough),

  To transfer a compressed library:

     1. Create a compressed copy of the library. See Saving a Compressed Copy of a Library for detailed
        instructions. The compressed library will have a .enlx extension.

     2. Copy the compressed library file to the new computer via a thumbdrive, a syncing folder, a network
        drive, or email.

     3. On the new computer, place the compressed library in the location you want to permanently store it.

     4. Open the compressed library from EndNote, uncompressing it. See Restoring a Compressed Library
        File for instructions. In the future, open the .enl file to open the library. This will be an uncompressed
        file.

   Note: If using a cloud-syncing service such as OneDrive, iCloud, or Dropbox to transfer the compressed
   library, move it out of the syncing folder before opening the library. Uncompressed libraries should not be
   used in cloud-syncing folders to avoid data corruption.


   Note: EndNote libraries larger than 4 gigabytes or 65,535 files cannot be compressed with EndNote’s
   Compressed Library command.


Transferring a Copy Made through the Save a Copy Command
  If your library is too large to compress, you could save an uncompressed copy of the library and transfer it
  via a network or thumb drive. See Saving a Copy of a Library for more information.

  To transfer an uncompressed copy of a library:

     1. Select Save a Copy from the File menu in EndNote.

     2. Name the file and select the location you want to save the copy, such as an external hard drive or
        thumb drive. By default, EndNote will use the original file name and add "Copy" at the end, but you
        can change the name.

     3. The recipient of the library can use Windows Explorer to copy the library files to their own computer.

Sharing a Library
   If you wish to give a colleague access to your EndNote library, with automatic updates, consider sharing
   your library with them through EndNote Sync. This would enable both of you to make changes to the library
   and have them automatically synchronized between computers, and would eliminate any problems with
   incompatibility from using different versions of EndNote. You can find information on this in About Shared
   Libraries.

Working with References
   The heart of your EndNote library is your references. EndNote provides many tools for working with
   references and their related files.


The Reference Panel
   The Reference Panel toolbar includes three tabs, which open up the following panels: Summary, Edit, and
   PDF

   It also contains three buttons:

             Open the reference in a new window

             Reference panel options

             Close the reference panel

The Summary Panel

   The updated Summary panel contains a Summary subpanel, showing a summary of the reference at the
   top, and a Preview subpanel at the bottom, showing how the selected reference would appear in the style of
   your choice. The size of the subpanels can be changed by dragging the line separating them. The Preview
   subpanel can also be hidden or shown using the chevron button at the right.




       Page 40 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


The Preview Subpanel

   Select the Preview subpanel to view the formatted style of the selected reference.

    Note: The Preview subpanel may originally show only the top toolbar, where you can select the style for
    the preview. Drag it up to see more of the preview, or click the chevron button ( ).

   The preview displays the selected reference in your current style. If multiple references are selected, it
   displays just the last one in the selection. Fields within the Preview feature are not editable. To edit the
   reference, select the Edit panel.

Choosing the Current Style

   The Preview panel uses the current style. To select another style:

       ▪ On the Preview toolbar, shown between the Summary and Preview subpanels, use the drop-down
          Output Styles menu to select a new style.

       ▪ From the Tools menu, select Output Styles, and select a style in the list. The check mark next to a
          style name indicates that it is the current style

   EndNote provides over 7,500 styles. Although not all styles are installed with a default installation, you can
   add more later. Styles installed on your computer are available from the Style Manager. Go to the Tools
   menu, select Output Styles, and then select Open Style Manager. Mark the style or styles that you would
   like to see in the Output Styles menu. You should now be able to select the style that you need from the
   Output Styles menu. For more information, see The Style Manager.

Previewing Multiple References

   The Preview subpanel displays a preview for only one reference at a time, formatted according to the
   current style. To preview multiple references:

      1. Select (highlight) the references in the Reference List.

      2. From the References menu, select Copy Formatted Reference to copy the formatted references to
         the Clipboard.

      3. Use the Clipboard Viewer to view the contents of the Clipboard or paste the formatted references
         into a word processor document.

Using the Preview Feature to Display Notes or Abstracts

   You may find it useful to configure the Library window so that the reference list displays bibliographic data
   (such as author, year, title, and journal) and the Preview subpanel displays notes or abstracts. That would
   allow you to browse through the references in the Reference List without having to move through the Edit
   panel of individual references to see more about them.

   To get the preview to display notes or the abstract, you will need to create a custom style to include just
   those fields.

   You can use the Show All Fields style to display all reference fields in the Preview subpanel.

Navigation Keys

       ▪ The Tab key allows you to move to the next field in the Edit panel in order to edit the contents of a
          field.

       ▪ The Shift+Tab keys allow you to move to the previous field within the Edit panel.

The PDF Panel

   Select PDF from the Reference panel to view and annotate attached PDF files.

   EndNote allows you to open, preview, and annotate PDF files within the PDF panel. Select a reference from
   the reference library, and then select the PDF panel to view a PDF file.

   If no PDF files are attached to the reference, EndNote displays a "No PDFs attached to this reference"
   message in the PDF panel. In this instance, you can begin attaching PDFs to the reference by clicking the
   Attach PDF button, and then selecting Attach File from the menu.

    Note: Although the button to attach files is called Attach PDF, many file types can be attached to an
    EndNote record. If attaching another type of file, the file can be opened in its default application from the
    Edit panel.


Open the Reference in a New Window

   You may find the Reference panel too small for annotating PDFs or editing extensive notes, abstracts, or
   lists of keywords in your reference easily, and may prefer to work in a larger window. To do this, click
   the Open Reference in New Window ( ) button. EndNote will default to opening the reference, the PDF, or
   both depending on the tab you had selected in the Reference panel.

   If the Edit tab is selected, at the left you will see the toolbar below for applying formatting to text in your
   reference, or changing the capitalization of selected text. At the right are buttons to save your changes and
   a drop-down Tools button to access the Find Reference Updates and Find Full Text commands without
   having to use the References menu.




       Page 43 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide




  If the PDF tab is selected, you will see the PDF and the toolbar below in the PDF Viewer, showing the file
  name of the attached PDF at the bottom, command buttons at the mid-left, and buttons for the Research
  Assistant, saving, quoting text, printing, emailing, or opening the file in your computer's default program for
  that file type outside of EndNote. (Changes made in your default program will be saved to the document in
  EndNote unless you use the "Save as" command to save a copy in another location.)




  If the Edit & PDF tab is selected, you will see both your reference and the PDF side-by-side in a new
  window, with the appropriate toolbars above each side.

  See the Working with PDFs section for detailed information on working with PDFs and using the tools in the
  PDF Viewer. See Artificial Intelligence (AI) in EndNote: The Research Assistant for information on the
  Research Assistant feature.



Reference Commands
  Commands affecting an entire reference, or set of references, are available under the References menu.
  Most of these commands are also available by right-clicking on a reference, then selecting the command
  from the list.


New Reference
  Select References > New Reference to create a new reference. Enter your data, then click the Close button
  to save and close the reference. You will be asked if you want to save the changes.


Edit Reference
  Select References > Edit Reference to move to the Edit panel for the selected reference.




      Page 44 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


Copy References To
   Select References > Copy References To to copy a set of selected reference(s) to a new library or another
   EndNote library on your computer.


Copy Formatted Reference
   Select References > Copy Formatted Reference to copy selected reference(s) as they would be formatted
   according to the currently selected style. The reference(s) can then be pasted into emails or documents.

    Note: The Copy Formatted Reference command pastes the reference(s) as formatted text, not as a Cite
    While You Write (CWYW) code, so the pasted references cannot be updated.


E-mail Reference
   Select References > E-mail Reference to have EndNote open your default desktop email application and
   create a new email with a formatted version of the reference inserted as text, and a subject line based on
   the reference. The format used will be the one selected in the Reference Preview subpanel. If there is a
   PDF attached to the reference, it will be included as an attachment of the email.

    Note: This feature will not work with online email websites or within browsers; it requires a dedicated
    desktop application, such as Outlook.


Move References to Trash
   Select References > Move References to Trash to have all selected references sent to the EndNote Trash.
   They will remain in the Trash until the Trash is emptied. If the library is synced, the contents of the Trash will
   be synced along with the rest of the library's contents.


File Attachments
   Select References > File Attachments to attach files to a reference, open an attachment in the default
   program for its file type, save a copy of an attachment outside of the EndNote library, convert attachments
   with absolute links to relative links, or rename attached PDFs.

    Note: Although PDFs tend to be the most common attachments, almost any file type can be attached to
    an EndNote record. Attachments with relative links will be stored in the .Data folder and will sync;
    attachments with absolute links are not stored in the .Data folder and will not sync. See Selecting a
    Relative Path or an Absolute Path for File Attachments for more information.


Find Full Text
   Select References > Find Full Text to have EndNote attempt to find and download available PDFs matching
   the reference(s).




       Page 45 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


Find Reference Updates
  Select a reference, or set of references, in the Reference List, then select References > Find Reference
  Updates to look for updated information for the reference(s). EndNote searches for and retrieves available
  field updates for the selected reference(s). If a reliable match is found, EndNote displays a Review Available
  Updates dialog that shows you the updates that were found. See Find Reference Updates for more
  information.


URL
  The References > URL command contains two options:

      1. It can use OpenURL to find local copies of the reference. If Find Full Text does not find the PDF you
         need, try selecting References > URL > OpenURL Link to connect to your library services and find
         the PDF.

      2. It can open the website of the URL in the URL field or the record.


Figure
  Select References > Figure to attach a graphic file to the reference using the Figure field, or to open a
  graphic in the Figure field. The Figure field can contain only one file and can be used to insert graphic files
  into Word documents using Cite While You Write. If you have previously attached a file to the reference
  using the Figure field that you would prefer to move to the File Attachments field, there is also an option to
  convert the file to an attachment.


Web of Science
  Select References > Web of Science to quickly access the Web of Science source record for the reference,
  related records for the reference, or to create a citation report for selected reference(s).

   Note: You must have access to the Web of Science to use this feature.


Reference Summary
  Select a single reference, then select References > Reference Summary to view a summary of information
  about the selected reference. An example of the information included is shown below.

Important Points About References
  There are various ways to add references to an EndNote library. This topic, and the following topics, discuss
  how to type information into EndNote, edit EndNote references, and insert graphics and files.




      Page 46 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


  See How to Search an Online Database for information about connecting to online bibliographic databases
  and retrieving references directly into EndNote. Importing Reference Data into EndNote describes how to
  import references from a variety of sources using EndNote’s Import command.

  Here is an overview of important aspects of EndNote references:

      ▪ Each EndNote reference stores the information required to cite it in a bibliography. Keywords, notes,
         abstracts, URLs, and other information can be stored in a reference as well.

      ▪ Each reference added to a library is automatically assigned a unique record number for that library. If
         a reference is copied to another library, synced to a library on another computer, or even cut-and-
         pasted within the same library, the record number will change, so these numbers should not be
         considered permanent identifiers. EndNote uses these record numbers to format papers. You cannot
         change these record numbers.

      ▪ You can create up to 999,995 references in an EndNote library. However, we suggest limiting
         libraries to about 50,000 references for best performance.

      ▪ Fifty-eight reference types are already defined (such as Journal Article, Book, Conference
         Proceedings, and so on). Three additional Unused reference types are available so you can define
         your own. See the List of Reference Types.

      ▪ The fields (Author, Title, Year, and so on) displayed for each reference type can be modified or
         deleted. New fields can also be added, up to a total of 52 fields per reference, including the
         reference type name.

      ▪ The text of the references should remain as Plain Text unless a special font, size, or style of text is
         required for a specific term or character.

      ▪ The font size used to display the text in references can be changed using the Display
         Font Preferences.

      ▪ You can insert one graphic or file into the Figure field of a record, and the figure can be cited in
         Microsoft Word. See Figures. However, you can insert up to 45 files into the File Attachments field.
         See Linking a File to an EndNote Reference.

      ▪ New references are automatically saved when they are closed; however, you may save a reference
         while editing the reference using the Save command from the File menu.


Special Fields
  There are two special tagging fields which appear in the library display, not in the Reference panel: Mark as
  Read/Mark as Unread and Rating. If you choose not to display these fields in the Reference List, you can
  still edit them by right-clicking on a reference, then select them from the list.

  Mark as Read/Mark as Unread Button: Use these toggle buttons to apply a Read or Unread status tag to
  the current reference. EndNote automatically saves your selection. You can set options for this field in the
  preferences.

  Rating: Apply a rating to the reference selected in the library list to signify the importance of the current
  reference to your research. Apply up to five stars (or none) by clicking a dot in the Rating field in the library
  list.

Selecting References
  To work with individual references (for example to copy, export, or edit them), first select them in the
  Reference List. The simplest way is to click on a reference in the Reference List. That reference is then
  highlighted to indicate it is selected.

  You can also select a reference by typing the first few letters found in the field by which the library is
  currently sorted. For example, if the library is sorted by the author field, type the first few letters of an
  author’s last name to select the first reference by that author. If the library is sorted based on title, type the
  first few letters of the title of the reference that you want to select. (When typing the letters to match a title,
  articles such as "a," "an," and "the" are skipped.)

  To select multiple references:

      ▪ Mark the box to the left of the reference. (This works with temporary online search results only.)

      ▪ Hold down the Ctrl key while clicking on individual references. Press the Ctrl key and click on a
         selected reference to deselect that reference and retain the rest of the selection.

      ▪ Select a range of references by clicking on the first reference, then press the Shift key and click on
         the last reference of the range.

      ▪ You can also select a range of references by holding down the mouse button and dragging the
         mouse vertically across a range of references.

      ▪ Choose Select All from the Edit menu to select all of the references showing in the current reference
         list. When all the references are selected, the Select All command changes to Unselect All.



The Reference Summary
  To see a list of statistics about a reference, select the reference, then go to the References menu and select
  Reference Summary.

  If you wish to save and print this information, use the Copy text to clipboard button and then paste the text
  into a word processor document.

  For a list of statistics about the library, see The Library Status.


Saving References
  To save a reference that you have just created or to save any changes made to an existing reference:

      ▪ Click the Save button.

      ▪ Select a different reference. You will be asked if you want to save the changes to the reference you
         were working with.

      ▪ From the File menu, select Save.

      ▪ Use the keyboard shortcut of Ctrl+S.



      Page 48 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


  If you Exit from EndNote while editing a reference, a confirmation window will appear asking if you want to
  save the changes to the reference.


Deleting References
  To delete references:

     1. Select (highlight) those references you want to delete.

     2. Do one of these, which moves the selected references to the Trash group:

         ▪ Drag the selected references and drop them on the Trash group.

         ▪ From the References menu, select Move References to Trash.

         ▪ Press the Delete key on your keyboard.
  When you are absolutely certain that you want to delete the references in the Trash, right-click on the Trash
  group and select Empty Trash.

  You must confirm that you want to remove the references from the library.

  If you want to permanently delete only some of the references in the Trash, select those references in the
  Trash, then select Delete Trash References from the References menu.

   Note: You cannot undo the Empty Trash or Delete Trash References commands, so be sure you want to
   delete the reference(s) in the Trash before dismissing the EndNote warning.


About the Trash Group
  The Trash group contains references you have removed from the library by using any of the methods
  mentioned above. While the references are officially no longer in your library (they will not appear in any
  other group or reference list, they are not included in your reference count, and they cannot be searched or
  cited), they are not completely deleted until you empty them from Trash.

  Until you select Empty Trash, you can still drag references from the Trash group back to the All References
  group of your active library. You can also highlight a reference in the Trash group, right-click the reference,
  and select Restore to Library. However, references restored to the Library will not be restored to any custom
  groups they belonged to, you will need to restore the custom group associations manually.

   Note: When you delete a reference, you delete its record number in that library forever. Even if you paste
   the reference back into the same library, it is assigned a new, unique record number. This may cause
   incompatibilities with older papers that have unformatted citations that use old record numbers. We
   strongly recommend that you do not delete references that have been used in papers that you might want
   to reformat later, and keep backups of your libraries!



Find Reference Updates
  Select and update individual or multiple references using the Find Reference Updates feature by retrieving
  information from source databases outside EndNote such as Web of Science Core Collection and PubMed.



      Page 49 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


  The Find Reference Updates feature is available from the References menu.

  When you select this feature, EndNote searches for and retrieves available field updates for the selected
  reference.

  EndNote uses the following process when searching for field updates.

     1. EndNote first looks for the DOI (Digital Object Identifier) that matches the DOI of the selected record.
        If a reliable match is found, EndNote displays the Review Reference Updates dialog and displays the
        field updates.

     2. If EndNote cannot find a matching DOI number, it looks for the author name, year of publication, and
        journal title that matches the selected record. If a reliable match is found, EndNote displays the
        Review Reference Updates dialog and displays the field updates.

     3. If no match is found, then a message that all references are up to date is displayed.

   Note: The Find Reference Updates feature is designed for journal articles. It will probably not work for
   other reference types, even if they are available in PubMed or Web of Science.

  To update a reference:

     1. Select one or more references from the Reference List.

     2. From the References menu, select Find Reference Updates.

     3. All updates are highlighted in blue in both the Available Updates and the My Reference panels. An
        update exists for a field in the My Reference panel when the field is empty or differs from the
        information in the same field in the Available Updates panel. For each update that EndNote finds for
        a record, you can:

         ▪ Click the Update All Fields button to update all the fields in the My References panel with updated
             information from the Available Updates panel. EndNote will ask if you want to apply this choice to
             all references to be updated. If you click Yes, you will not be given a choice of how to update the
             rest of the references to be updated.

         ▪ Click the Update Empty Fields button to update every empty field in the My Reference panel with
             the new information from the Available Updates panel. EndNote will ask if you want to apply this
             choice to all references to be updated. If you click Yes, you will not be given a choice of how to
             update the rest of the references to be updated.

         ▪ Edit the reference manually by selecting the Edit Reference option, making your changes, then
             clicking the Save and Continue button to save your changes and continue to the next record.

            Note: If you have selected more than one reference, click the Skip button to skip a particular
            reference that you do not wish to update.

            All fields in the My Reference panel will display, even if they are empty.


Editing a Reference in Find Reference Updates
  After selecting the Edit Reference option, you can copy any of the information from a retrieved field and
  paste the information into the same field in the My Reference panel. You can also edit any of the fields in the


      Page 50 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


  My Reference panel. The following edit options are available: Cut, Copy, Paste, Paste with Text Styles, and
  Select All.

  You cannot edit any of the retrieved fields from the Available Updates panel.


Creating a New Reference
  To add a new reference to an open library:

     1. From the References menu, select New Reference (Ctrl+N). This opens an empty Reference
        window.

     2. Select a reference type from the Reference Type field at the top of the window.

     3. Enter bibliographic data into each of the fields in the reference. For guidance, see Entering
        References. When you are finished, Close the reference to save it and add it to the library.

  After a new reference has been saved, you can edit it in the Reference Edit panel.


Entering References
  Bibliographic information (as well as keywords, notes, and other relevant information) is entered into
  separate fields in each EndNote reference. By storing the pieces of bibliographic data in different fields,
  EndNote can later rearrange the elements to conform to various bibliographic formats (such as APA or
  MLA).

  Special bibliographic formatting and punctuation should not be included when you enter reference data into
  EndNote. For example, you do not need to put quotes around titles, italicize journal names, or include the
  abbreviation "Vol." along with volume numbers. Enter only the raw data, and leave the formatting to
  EndNote.

   Note: There are a few exceptions to this punctuation rule, notably in the Author, Editor, and Edition fields.
   See the detailed topics on those fields for more information.

  Keyboard commands are available for many functions, reducing the need to use the mouse. See Keyboard
  Commands.

  The Reference Type selected for a reference determines which fields will be available. The Generic
  Reference Type is the one all others are based on, so it is the only Reference Type where all fields will be
  available. It is possible to customize Reference Types if you need a field that is not available in the default
  set. See Customizing Reference Types for more information.

   Note: Selecting a font from the Edit > Font menu should not be used for changing the display. Overriding
   the plain font will affect your bibliographies.

Field Size Restrictions
   The Figure field can contain a single graphic.

   All other fields can contain up to 64 KB or approximately 16 pages of plain text. The exact number of pages
   will depend on the font size.


Choosing a Reference Type
   When you create a new reference, that reference is assigned the default reference type. If you want to add
   a different type of reference, click the List of Reference Types at the top of the Edit panel, and select the
   reference type that you need.

   Normally, you should select the reference type before entering information in the reference because the
   fields available will vary by reference type. However, you can change the reference type at any time, and the
   information you have entered is retained and transferred to the corresponding fields for the new reference
   type.

   In addition to determining how the reference is formatted in the bibliography, the reference type determines
   which fields appear in the Reference window. For example, a Journal Article reference would have fields for
   Journal, Volume, and Issue, whereas a Book would have fields for Editor and Publisher.

Customizing Fields and Reference Types

   Fields can be removed, added, or renamed. You can also rename reference types. See Customizing
   Reference Types for more information.


Tips for Choosing the Right Reference Type
   Use Book for books written by one or more authors, and use Edited Book for books edited by one or more
   editors (whether they are books in a series or not).

   Use Book Section for references to parts of edited or nonedited books (a chapter, for example).

   The Conference Paper reference type is best used for unpublished papers. Articles that are published as
   part of the comprehensive conference proceedings should be entered as Conference Proceedings
   references.

   Use the Electronic Article, Electronic Book, or Web Page reference type for citing material from a Web page
   or FTP site. If you are citing a journal article that appears both online and in print, most style guides prefer
   that you use the print information and cite it as a regular journal article. Email discussions should be cited as
   Personal Communications, just like any other correspondence.

   Use the Chart or Table reference type if you want to include an image and later insert that image as a table
   in Microsoft Word. Images in all other reference types will insert into Word as figures, which are listed and
   numbered separately from tables.


Changing the Default Reference Type
   By default, new references appear as Journal Article references. You may change this by selecting the
   Default Reference Type option in the Preferences panel.

      1. From the Edit menu, select Preferences.

      2. Click the Reference Types option in the list.

      3. At the top of that Reference Types preferences panel, select the Default Reference Type list, and
         then select the reference type that new references should use.

   See Reference Types Preferences for more information.


Using Term Lists with Data Entry
   EndNote uses term lists for the Author and Editor names, Journals, and Keywords. Term lists can also be
   created for other fields. These lists are updated automatically as you enter or import new terms into these
   fields. The benefit of this is that the term lists also help with data entry. If you begin to enter a name, journal
   or keyword that you have used before in that library, EndNote will complete the term for you to speed up
   data entry.

   To accept a term that EndNote has suggested, press Enter, Tab, or click in the next field. Terms that are new
   (that is, those that do not already appear in the corresponding Author, Journals, or Keyword term list)
   appear in red text.

   A more complete discussion of EndNote’s term lists is provided in Introduction to Term Lists.



       Page 53 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


    Note: Both the "Auto-Update" and "Auto-Complete" term list features described here may be turned off
    using the Term Lists Preferences settings in the EndNote preferences.


Author and Editor Names
   The following information about Author and Editor fields applies to the following "Generic" field names:
   Author, Secondary Author, Tertiary Author, and Subsidiary Author.

   Always enter author and editor names with one name per line. If an author’s name is too long to fit on a
   single line, let it wrap to the next line as you type it.

   Author names can be entered either with the last name followed by a comma and the first name or the first
   name followed by the last name. Both are correct. However, if you have the "Suggest Terms as You Type"
   feature of the term lists turned on, EndNote suggests author names based on names entered with the last
   name first.

   EndNote can abbreviate first and middle names, so for maximum flexibility enter whole names whenever
   possible. If you are entering initials instead of full names, be sure to type a period, a space, or a period and
   a space between initials; otherwise EndNote interprets the initials as a single name. For example, entering
   "JO Fisher" or "Fisher, JO" would result in "JO" being perceived as the single name "Jo" and formatted as
   "J." in the APA style instead of "J. O." However, using any of the data entry formats below would result in the
   name being formatted according to the APA requirements.

       ▪ James Oscar Fisher
       ▪ James O. Fisher
       ▪ Fisher, James Oscar
       ▪ Fisher, James O.
       ▪ Fisher, J. O.
       ▪ Fisher, J.O.
       ▪ Fisher, J O
       ▪ J. O. Fisher
       ▪ J.O. Fisher
       ▪ J O Fisher

    Note: EndNote will not perceive an author's name entered as a full name to be the same author as a
    name entered with initials. EndNote's author term list is not designed to work with full and abbreviated
    versions of a name. This means that to meet requirements for styles which require special formatting
    when there are multiple works by the same author, such as a solid line instead of repeating the author's
    name in the reference list, it is important to enter the author's name the same way in all records.

   See Additional Style Formatting Options for information about how EndNote can use style settings to format
   author names in bibliographies. For more information about term lists, see Introduction to Term Lists.

Using "et al." or Similar Abbreviations

   Enter all author names for a particular reference. EndNote will truncate the list of authors with "et al." or "and
   others" as required by the bibliographic style. If you do not know all of the authors’ names, then the last
   author should be "et al." or "and others" followed by a comma.


       Page 54 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


Anonymous Works

   If a reference has no author, leave the Author field blank. Do not enter "Anonymous." The style that you use
   to format the bibliography determines how anonymous references are treated.

   Note that if a work is published with "Anonymous" printed on the title page, most style guides request that
   "Anonymous" be entered as though it were the author name.

Corporate Authors

   When entering corporate authors, put a comma after the name:

          U.S. Department of Agriculture,

          Apple Computer Inc.,

   This ensures that the entire name is treated as a last name, so no name manipulation will be applied.

   If a corporate author name includes a comma in the name itself, use two commas in place of the first
   comma:

          Apple Computer,, Inc.

   EndNote treats this as a last name, followed by a blank first name, and then a suffix. As a result, everything
   after the (blank) first name is appended, with the second comma treated as text instead of the identifier
   between the first and last name. The formatted result of the corporate name above would be "Apple
   Computer, Inc."

Complex Author Names

   For multiple-word last names, like Charles de Gaulle, enter the name with the last name first, such as:

          de Gaulle, Charles

   Entering a name this way ensures that both words "de" and "Gaulle" will format as the last name.

   Enter authors with titles, such as "Jr." or "III" as Last, First, Title. For example, "Alfred Smith, Jr." must be
   entered as:

          Smith, Alfred, Jr.

   The text after the second comma will print exactly as entered and the second comma will always be
   included as part of the suffix. For the example above, the name would show as "Alfred Smith, Jr." but could
   not be formatted as "Alfred Smith Jr."

    Note: See the Sorting Preferences section of the EndNote preferences if you do not want EndNote to
    include prepositions (such as de, van, von, and so on) when it alphabetizes references in a bibliography.


The Year Field
   Normally, you should enter the four numbers of the year of publication, as in 2023. When appropriate, you
   may enter "in press," or "in preparation," or some other notation.



       Page 55 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


    Note: When you transfer references from an outside source into EndNote, only valid dates are parsed
    and transferred. Text such as "submitted" or "in print" is ignored, and year ranges such as 2010-11 may
    not import as expected. However, you can manually type this information into the reference. Also, only
    one item can be imported into the year field, so if year information appears more than once in import data,
    only the first item will be imported into the Year field.


Title Fields
   The following information about Title fields applies to the "Generic" fields Title, Secondary Title, Tertiary Title,
   and Alternate Title.

   Enter titles without a period or any other punctuation at the end. Do not press the Enter key while typing
   titles into EndNote; allow long titles to just wrap to the next line. Although the EndNote styles can change
   the capitalization of titles, it is best to capitalize the title in the same way you would like it to be capitalized in
   your bibliographies.


Journal Name Fields
   The Journal field is automatically set up to work with the Journals term list. This means that the Journals list
   is updated as you add new journal names to your references, and EndNote will use this list to facilitate data
   entry by suggesting journal names as you enter them into the Journal field.

   The Journal fields (in the Journal Article reference type) can be used with the Journals term list to allow for
   multiple formats of a journal name to be used in your bibliographies, depending on the format required (see
   Creating Bibliographies with Journal Abbreviations). When the different forms of the journal name are
   entered into the Journals term list, all it takes to change the format of your journal names in a bibliography is
   one change in the style used (see Journal Names). All of the appropriate substitutions are made when the
   bibliography is created.

   EndNote includes several predefined journal lists in the Terms folder. If you would like to use these lists, you
   should import them into your Journals list as described in Loading Supplied Journal Abbreviations.

The Journal Field

   When using a Journals term list, new contents in the Journal field will be interpreted as a full journal name
   and added to the list as such. If an entry shows up in red, the name has not been used in the Journals term
   list before.

The Alternate Journal Field

   When using a Journals term list, new contents in the Alternate Journal field will be interpreted as the journal
   abbreviation and added to the list as such.

The Journals Terms List

   If EndNote has a predefined journals term list for your area of study, importing it when you create your
   library will eliminate many problems.

   Some databases export the full journal name, some export the abbreviation, and some export both. If the
   term list is automatically updated from references where the names are not consistent in the Journal and
   Alternate Journal fields, EndNote will be unable to create a bibliography where the journal name formats are
   consistent. EndNote will not add a new name if that name already exists anywhere in the term list, so having
   an abbreviation in the Journal field or the full name in the Alternate Journal field is not a problem when an

       Page 56 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   "official" version of the name already exists in the term list—because you imported the list before adding
   references!


The Pages Field
   Page ranges can be entered as complete (1442-1449) or abbreviated (1442-9) ranges. The style used to
   create the bibliography will change the page numbers to match the style requirements, either full number
   ranges, abbreviated page ranges, or just the first page (see Page Numbers).

   Do not use commas in the Pages field for page numbers in the thousands. EndNote will add them, if
   needed.

   This field is one of three than can be used in EndNote temporary citations in place of the EndNote record
   number. The other two fields are Accession Number and Label. You can find more information on this in
   Temporary Citations Preferences.


The Edition Field
   The text of the Edition field is not modified by EndNote for your bibliographies, so be sure to enter it exactly
   as you want it to appear. For example, "1st," "2nd," and so on for this field if that is what you need in your
   bibliography.


The Date Field
   In the Date field of your references, enter dates as you would like them to appear in your formatted list or
   bibliography; EndNote does not reformat dates. The output style determines which date field prints in your
   bibliographic references.

    Note: When you transfer references from an outside source into EndNote, only valid dates are parsed
    and transferred. Text such as "submitted" or "in print" is ignored. However, you can manually type this
    information into the reference.


Auto Date Stamps
   Two Auto Date Stamp fields are tracked in EndNote and can be added to the Reference List panel display.

   The Added to Library and Last Updated date fields are inserted when you save a new reference. The Last
   Updated date is reset each time you save changes to a reference. The date format of the Auto Date Stamp
   fields matches your default operating system settings (for example, 4/16/2020).

   To add the two Auto Date Stamp fields to the Reference List panel, select Edit > Preferences > Display
   Fields. From the Field column, select the Added to Library and/or Last Updated fields. EndNote populates
   the Heading column with your selection.

   You cannot edit, print, or export either of the Auto Date Stamp fields. You can, however, display and sort
   these fields from the Reference List panel just as you can any other EndNote field.

    Note: For references entered with EndNote version X1 or earlier, the Added to Library field is left blank
    and the Last Updated field displays the date of conversion to EndNote.




       Page 57 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


The Short Title Field
   Use the Short Title field to enter abbreviated versions of the regular title which should be used as part of an
   in-text citation or a footnote citation. This is a common request for many of the humanities styles, which use
   a shortened form of the title in the citation to help identify which reference is being cited. For example, MLA
   typically lists just the author name and the specifically cited pages in the in-text citation:

          (Perin 141)

   But if there are multiple works by that author, MLA requires that the title or a shortened form of it be added to
   the citation. If the full title of the reference is fairly long, such as Burning the Midnight Oil: Tales from Working
   the Night Shift, you should enter an easily recognizable form of the title that starts with the first word on
   which the normal title would be sorted. For example:

          (Perin, Burning the Midnight Oil 141)

   If an EndNote style is configured to use the Short Title field, and that field is empty for a particular reference,
   the normal Title field is used instead


The Original Publication Field
   Use the Original Publication field to enter any information about the original publication that you
   need included in the cited reference. For example, when citing a republished book you might want to include
   the original publication date, as well as any other supplementary information about the original publication
   (such as place published and publisher). Enter this information just as you would want it to appear in your
   formatted bibliography reference (including text formatting and punctuation).


The Reprint Edition Field
   Use the Reprint Edition field for references that were originally published under a different title. The field
   should include the original title and year to indicate that this reference is a reprint of an earlier publication.
   Enter this information exactly as you would want it to appear in your formatted reference (including text
   formatting and punctuation).

    Note: This field is not intended to be used to indicate whether or not you have a reprint of the article on
    file.


The Reviewed Item Field
   Use the Reviewed Item field for articles or chapters that are critical reviews of books, cinema, art, or other
   works. The contents of the Reviewed Item field varies depending on the type of review that you are citing,
   but typically you should enter the title of the reviewed work and the primary person responsible for it (author,
   artist, performer, and so on). Additional information about a production or performance may also be
   included. Enter the information exactly as you want it to appear in the formatted references (including
   punctuation and text formatting).


The ISBN/ISSN Field
   ISSN (International Standard Serial Number) and ISBN (International Standard Book Number) are codes
   used to identify a particular publication. An ISSN number would refer to an entire journal (such as the




       Page 58 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   Journal of Virology), and an ISBN would refer to a particular edition of a book. An electronic edition of a
   book would have a different ISBN than a print edition, for example.

   These numbers help to identify a specific publication if you need to order it or locate it. This field is also used
   for Report Number and Patent Number in the Report and Patent reference types.


The DOI Field
   A DOI (Digital Object Identifier) is a unique ID for locating a digital version of a document, PDF, or image. It
   is most useful if you are importing reference data or retrieving references directly from an online source. In
   early versions of EndNote, this field was titled "Electronic Resource Number."


The Accession Number Field
   This field is used to identify the internal tracking number for references imported from online databases. For
   example, if you import a reference from Clarivate Web of Science, the Web of Science Unique Identifier
   number will be imported into this field; if you import a reference from PubMed, the PMID will be imported
   into this field.

   This field is one of three than can be used in EndNote temporary citations in place of the EndNote record
   number. The other two fields are Label and Pages. You can find more information on this in Temporary
   Citations Preferences.

    Note: Only one item can be imported into this field. This means if a record from an online database
    contains both a Web of Science Unique Identifier and a PMID, only one of them can be imported into the
    Accession Number field. The other identifier will likely be imported into the Notes field.


The Call Number Field
   The Call Number field is used to store library call numbers. These are the codes that help you to locate a
   particular publication on the shelves in your library. When available, the EndNote connection files import the
   call number information into this field.


The Label Field
   The Label field can be used for many purposes, such as special in-text citations or reprint numbers.

   When converting references from other reference management systems, the record number from the
   previous system is imported into the Label field, for example, when converting a Reference Manager
   database to EndNote.

   Some citation styles require that citations include only part of the author’s name, such as [SMIT 90].
   EndNote cannot create this citation for you, but if you type " SMIT 90" into the Label field and use the Label
   field in your style’s citation template, EndNote will insert the Label field into the citation.

   This field is one of three than can be used in EndNote temporary citations in place of the EndNote record
   number. The other two fields are Accession Number and Pages. You can find more information on this in
   Temporary Citations Preferences.

   If you do not need the Label field for citation purposes, it can be used as an additional field for categorizing
   references or storing reprint numbers. (Do not use EndNote’s record numbers to number reprints because



       Page 59 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


  these numbers change when references are moved to different libraries. EndNote’s record numbers cannot
  be assigned or changed by the user, but the Label field can be edited.)


The Keywords Field
  Use the Keywords field to store keywords that you want to associate with a reference. You can restrict a
  search to just the Keywords field, so the terms you enter into this field can be used to later retrieve the
  references when using EndNote’s Search command.

  By default, EndNote will also import keywords from online databases into the Keywords field.

  The Keywords term list (which maintains a list of terms used in the Keywords field) can be set up to
  recognize semicolons (;), slashes (/), backslashes (\), and returns as delimiters that separate individual
  keywords. If you would prefer to use other punctuation to separate your keywords, you may change these
  settings using the Define Term Lists command under the Library menu.


The Abstract, Notes, and Research Notes Fields
  The Abstract, Notes, and Research Notes fields can each hold up to 64,000 characters, which is equivalent
  to about 16 pages of text. Use the Notes field to store personal reminders, such as the location of a
  quotation in a book or the quotation itself. Use the Abstract field for a brief description of the contents of the
  work. Use the Research Notes field to create personal annotated bibliographies.


The URL Field
  URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the term for the address used to locate a specific page of information
  with your Web browser.

  To link a URL to a reference in your EndNote library:

     1. Select a reference in the Reference List and select the Edit panel. Put your cursor in the URL field.

     2. Type or paste a valid URL into the field. For example:

             https://endnote.com/

                  or

             https://clarivate.com/

     3. The URL becomes a hyperlink (blue and underlined).

  If you need to enter multiple links into the URL field, enter them one per line. Adding any other information
  along with the URL or path and filename may keep the Open URL command from successfully finding the
  desired site.

  When a correctly formatted URL is entered into the URL field, the URL > Open URL command on the
  References menu can be used to launch a Web browser and take you to that site or file.

  Some online reference databases include a URL for the full text of an article online. When importing or
  retrieving references directly from these sources, the URLs can import directly into this field to take
  advantage of the Open URL command. You can also store a URL to related information on the Web or other
  relevant material.



      Page 60 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   EndNote automatically recognizes URLs if they are entered with the correct prefix, such as "https://,"
   "http://," or "ftp://." When recognized, they become clickable Web links and appear as blue and underlined
   text. Simply clicking on one of these links will open your Web browser and go to the address given. This
   feature is not specific to the URL field. See Linking References to Files and Web Sites.


The File Attachments Field
   Use the File Attachments field to store the path to PDF files (and other file types) on your hard drive.

    Note: Use the Figure field to attach a graphic or file that you want to insert into a Word document with
    Cite While You Write.

   To link a file to a reference in your EndNote library:

      1. Select a reference in the Reference List.

      2. From the References menu, select File Attachments > Attach File.

      3. On the file dialog, select the file to attach to your reference.

      4. Note the checkbox along the bottom titled, "Copy this file to the default file attachments folder and
         create a relative link." This gives you the option to:

           ▪ Select the checkbox to copy the original file and place the copy in the .Data\PDF folder that is
              part of your EndNote library. In this location, it will sync through EndNote Web/Online.

           ▪ Deselect the checkbox to always have EndNote look in the original folder for the inserted file. If
              kept in the original location, the attachment will not sync through EndNote Web/online.

          For more information about this option, see Selecting a Relative Path or an Absolute Path for File
          Attachments.

      5. Click Open.

   EndNote will display an icon indicating the type of file inserted. You can insert up to 45 files into the same
   File Attachments field.

    Note: Another way to link a file to the File Attachments field is to drag and drop the file onto the reference
    in either the Library window or the Reference Edit panel. Whether the file is saved with the database or is
    linked with an absolute path is determined by the default file attachment setting. See URLs and Links
    Preferences.


    Note: In order to maintain cross-platform compatibility, any of the following characters in a filename will be
    replaced by an underscore when EndNote saves a copy of the file in the .Data\PDF folder with a relative
    path.


                  These characters are
              replaced with an underscore
               \      back slash
               /      forward slash
               :      colon

  To automatically search online to locate and attach the full text of a referenced document, see Finding Full
  Text for a Reference.

   Note: Never rename attached files within the DATA folder. EndNote assigns each file a unique name that
   helps link it to a specific reference.


The Figure and Caption Fields
  The Figure field can contain a graphic or file attachment. See Figures.

  The Figure field is included by default for all reference types, but you can remove it from any reference type
  or rename it in any reference type.

   Note: Each reference can contain only one item in the Figure field.

  The figure itself is copied to the [library name].Data folder found in the same folder as the library file.

  A related Caption field appears directly under the Figure field in a reference. Use this field for a short
  description of the image or file.

  Cite While You Write allows you to insert the figure and its caption into a Microsoft Word document. See
  Finding and Inserting Figures and Tables. Figures in most reference types will insert into Word as figures.
  The only exception is the Chart or Table reference type; use the Chart or Table reference type if you want to
  include an image and later insert that image as a table in Microsoft Word. Tables are listed and numbered
  separately from figures in Word.


The PMCID and NIHMSID Fields
  Unlike most of the fields described in this section, the PMCID and NIHMSID fields are not generic fields.
  They occur only in the Journal Article and Electronic Article reference types. As you can see below, the
  generic names for these fields are Custom 2 and Custom 6.




      Page 62 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide




  The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) requires that the PMCID be reported by some authors, so it is
  important to track this information and be able to use it if you are working with the NIH. You can find
  information on requirements for using these numbers at https://publicaccess.nih.gov/include-pmcid-
  citations.htm.

  What is the difference between these two? The PMCID is the unique permanent identifier assigned when an
  article is approved for publication at PubMed Central (PMC). The NIHMSID is a temporary identifier
  assigned when an article is submitted for publication at PubMed Central. The NIHMSID is only to be used
  for the first 90 days after it is assigned or until an article has been granted a PMCID. You can find more
  information on this at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/public-access-info/.

   Note: The PMID is not equivalent to either of these numbers. The PMID is the unique identifier for an
   article in the PubMed database and would be imported into the Accession Number field when importing
   references from PubMed, or into the Notes field when importing references from the Web of Science.



Font, Size, and Style
  EndNote is designed to produce bibliographies that automatically use the font and size of the text in your
  word-processing documents. Normally, when you type text into an EndNote reference, it is entered in a
  default Plain font, size, and style, which means that your references follow the font settings in your paper.

  If any fonts, sizes, or styles other than the default are entered into your library, they will appear in your
  bibliography regardless of the font of your paper. For example, you can italicize species names, add a
  superscript number, or enter Greek characters such as D.



      Page 63 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


  To apply font or text styles, select the text to be changed and then select the desired font options from
  the Edit menu or the Font toolbar.

  EndNote supports Unicode UTF-8, allowing you to enter Unicode characters into references as well as the
  characters available through the font options.

   Note: If the Font, Size, and Style (bold, etc.) options are dim, it is either because you are not in an editing
   window (such as a Reference or Style window), or you have not selected (highlighted) any text to
   change.



Plain Text
  The Plain Font, Plain Size, and Plain Style commands on the Edit menu remove overriding formatting from
  the selected text.

  When EndNote creates a bibliography, text in Plain Font and Plain Size uses the font and size of your paper.
  To use these commands, first select the text you want to change, and then select Plain Font, Plain Size, or
  Plain Style from the Edit menu.

  Text entered into EndNote without any special font, size, or style applied is considered plain text, which is
  formatted in the font and size of your paper. Once you specifically apply a font, size or style to text, that
  formatting overrides the plain text setting.

  The default font used to display EndNote’s "Plain Text" is the default font of your operating system. The
  General font setting does not affect the font of a bibliography created for a word processing document.


Keyboard Commands
  A full set of key commands is available so that you can enter references without using the mouse. For
  example, to create and enter a new reference without touching the mouse, select Ctrl+N to add a new
  reference, type the bibliographic information using Tab or Shift+Tab to move forward or backward between
  the fields, and then press Ctrl+W to save and close the reference.

      Turn underline on or off                      Ctrl+U


  Note: Use the Arrow keys to navigate within a field.



Special Characters
  EndNote references can include special characters, including characters with diacritics, Greek,
  mathematical, and typographical symbols. Diacritical characters are a part of standard Windows fonts, and
  many common symbols can be entered using the Symbol font.

  EndNote uses Unicode to encode special characters, so that data can be easily translated between
  platforms, programs, and languages.

  EndNote uses the default language setting of your operating system. If the characters you wish to use
  require installing a different language, see Working with Multiple Languages.

  Special characters can be entered into EndNote using any of these text-entry methods:

      ▪ Type the character on the keyboard (if the character is part of the language supported by the
         keyboard).




      Page 65 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      ▪ For common symbol characters, especially Greek characters, you can use the Symbol font by
         selecting Font > Symbol from the Edit menu.

      ▪ Copy the character from another program, and paste it into your EndNote library.

      ▪ Use The Character Map program supplied with Windows to copy characters into EndNote.
  Characters with diacritics can be entered into EndNote references and into EndNote term lists. If you
  frequently use certain diacritical characters, or words that include diacritical characters, you can store them
  in a term list and then select them from the list when entering references. See Introduction to Term Lists.
  However, only one term list can be associated with an EndNote field, so you will not be able to insert a
  special character from a term list into a field that already has a term list associated with it. You would need
  to enter it in another field, then cut-and-paste it into the field where you need it.

   Note: If characters from other languages do not appear as they should in EndNote, see Working with
   Multiple Languages.


The Character Map
  The Character Map program (CHARMAP.EXE) is supplied with all versions of Windows. Both diacritical
  characters and symbols can be entered using the Character Map.

  To use the Character Map program:

     1. Click the Search button on the Windows Taskbar.

     2. Type "character map" to find the application. The window showing the application will also show
        options to add it to Start or pin it to the Windows Taskbar. Setting one of these options will make it
        easier to access in the future.

     3. Open the Character Map program.

     4. Choose the system font for the character from the drop-down list. For Windows 10, the system font is
        Segoe UI, and for Windows 11, it is Segoe UI Variable.

     5. Select the character you want to copy to EndNote and click the Select button. The character will
        appear in the Characters to copy field.

     6. Click the Copy button, then paste the character into EndNote.

   Note: If you want to enter characters in another language that requires more than just adding diacritics or
   common symbols, you will need to add that language to your copy of Windows. See Working with Multiple
   Languages for more information.


Working with Multiple Languages
  The default font used in EndNote will support Unicode characters, including symbols and standard Greek
  and mathematical characters. However, if you want to work in more than one language, you may need to
  install those additional languages to be able to work with them easily in EndNote.

Entering Several Articles from the Same Source
  Use a reference "template" to facilitate entering a series of references that have some information in
  common (such as various sections from one book or a number of papers presented at the same
  conference). The template you create is an incomplete EndNote reference with just the common information
  entered into it.

  To create a reference template:

     1. From the References menu, select New Reference.

     2. Enter all of the bibliographic information that the references have in common (such as the year, book
        title, publisher, and city for different sections from one book).

     3. Close the reference when you are finished.

     4. Select the reference you just created in the Reference List.

     5. Select Copy (Ctrl+C) from the Edit menu to copy it.

     6. Use the Paste (Ctrl+V) command to paste the reference several times, to create as many partially
        filled references as you need. You should paste directly to the Reference List—do not open a new
        reference and select Paste.

     7. Select the first of the partially filled references that you just created and add the information unique to
        it. Save the reference, then go to the next partially filled reference and edit it. Continue until you have
        completed all the references.


Figures
  EndNote extends the organization of reference information by including the ability to embed files in an
  EndNote library using the Figure field and insert them in Microsoft Word documents. This feature is most
  useful for graphic files or tables. You can insert a graphic, figure, or file into the Figure field of any EndNote
  reference. See Inserting Graphics and Files.

   Note: While the Figure and Caption fields are included by default for all reference types, you can remove
   them at any time if you do not intend to use them. See Adding, Changing, and Hiding Reference Types.


   Note: While it is possible to insert almost any file in the Figure field, it is better to reserve this field for
   graphics you want to insert into Microsoft Word. The Figure field can only hold one file attachment while
   the File Attachments field can hold up to 45 file attachments, of almost any kind.

  Once you have a figure in your EndNote reference, Cite While You Write allows you to insert the figure and
  its caption into a Microsoft Word document. See Finding and Inserting Figures and Tables for more
  information about using images with Cite While You Write.


Selecting the Appropriate Reference Type
  You can insert a graphic or file into the Figure field of an EndNote reference. Depending on the reference
  type, the field may be labeled "Figure" or have a custom label assigned by you.



      Page 68 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   By default, the Figure and Caption fields are included in all reference types. So, while a reference to a
   journal may contain primarily bibliographic information, you can also include an illustration that appeared
   with the journal article.

   The Figure, Chart or Table, and Equation reference types should be used specifically to catalog image files,
   and may contain minimal reference information.

    Note: Figures in the "Chart or Table" reference type are inserted into Word as tables, and are labeled and
    numbered separately from the figures found in all other reference types.

   To add or remove the Figure and Caption fields from a reference type, go to the Edit menu, select
   Preferences, and then select Reference Types. For more information about modifying reference types, see
   Customizing Reference Types.


Inserting Graphics and Files

Notes on Figures:

       ▪ Always use the Figure > Attach Figure command to insert graphics and other files into the Figure
          field. If you use Copy and Paste, System settings are used and colors and other attributes from the
          original file could be lost.

       ▪ Each EndNote reference can contain only one graphic or file attachment in the Figure field. A second
          graphic or file inserted into a reference will replace the first one. The previous graphic or file will be
          deleted from the DATA folder. See Storing and Sharing Figure Files for more information about the
          DATA folder.

       ▪ After inserting a graphic, you should always type Caption text into the Caption field, particularly if you
          intend to later insert the figure into a Word document. The Caption will label the graphic in the figure
          list at the end of the Word document. The Caption also helps you search for the figure.

       ▪ You can insert a figure only into a reference that contains the Figure field. If you need to add the
          Figure field to a reference type, see Customizing Reference Types.

       ▪ In order to maintain cross-platform compatibility, any of the following characters in a filename will be
          replaced by an underscore when EndNote saves a copy of the file in the .Data folder.

                 These characters are
             replaced with an underscore
              \      back slash
              /      forward slash
              :      colon
              *      asterisk
              ?      question mark

Inserting Figures into EndNote References

      1. To insert a graphic (picture) or other file into the Figure field:

      2. Select the reference from the Reference List.

      3. Select Figure > Attach Figure from the References menu.

      4. Click Choose File to open a dialog where you can select the file to attach.

      5. Locate and select the graphic file, then click Open.

      6. If returned to the Attach Figure dialog, click OK to copy the file to your EndNote reference. A graphic
         appears as a thumbnail within the reference.

   EndNote recognizes at least these graphic file types:

       ▪ Windows Bitmap — BMP

       ▪ Graphics Interchange Format — GIF

       ▪ JPEG File Interchange Format — JPEG

       ▪ Portable Network Graphics — PNG

       ▪ Portable Document Format — PDF

       ▪ Tag Image File Format — TIFF
   Valid picture files are those that Microsoft Word recognizes as pictures.

   Other types of files will appear as an attachment, with the program icon and filename. (If the application
   used to create the document is not available on your system, the icon gives generic Windows file
   information.)

   Double-clicking on the thumbnail or file icon will launch an associated application to open the file, with the
   same effect as if you had double-clicked the file on your computer desktop.

   EndNote also recognizes at least these other file formats:

       ▪ Audio files (WAV, MP3)

       ▪ Microsoft Access files

       ▪ Microsoft Excel files

       ▪ Microsoft Power Point files

       ▪ Microsoft Project files

       ▪ Microsoft Visio files

       ▪ Microsoft Word files

       ▪ Multimedia files (MOV, QuickTime)


       Page 70 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       ▪ Technical drawing files

       ▪ Text files (TXT, RTF, HTML)

    Note: Unless you want to later insert the file into Microsoft Word, it is better to use the File Attachments
    field to attach files to records. The Figure field can hold only one file, the File Attachments field can hold
    up to 45 files.


The Figure Caption
   A related Caption field appears directly under the Figure field in a reference. Use this field for a short
   description of the image or file. The Caption field allows you to easily search for figures.

   If you insert an EndNote figure into a Word document with Cite While You Write, the corresponding caption
   appears either above or below the figure in your paper (the placement is determined by the current output
   style).


Editing Figure Files
   To edit a figure stored in an EndNote reference:

      1. Select the reference containing the figure in the Reference List.

      2. Select Figure > Open Figure from the References menu.

   This launches an associated application to open the file for editing.

   Editing changes are made to the file stored in the library’s .Data folder for the reference, not to the original
   figure file that was inserted.

    Note: Never rename figure files within the .Data folder. EndNote assigns each figure a unique name that
    helps link it to a specific reference.


Deleting or Replacing Figure Files
   To delete a figure from an EndNote reference:

      1. Select the reference in the Reference List

      2. Scroll down and click in the Figure field.

      3. Press the backspace key on your keyboard.

      4. Click the Save button to save your changes.

   Deleting a figure from the reference also deletes it from the .Data folder.

    Note: If you insert the same figure in two different references, EndNote stores two copies of the figure in
    the .Data folder. Deleting the figure from one of the references will not affect the other reference.

   To replace a figure in an EndNote reference, you can do one of these:


       Page 71 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      1. Select the reference from the Reference List and attach the new figure. The existing figure is deleted
         from the .Data folder and is replaced with the new figure.

      2. Delete the old figure from the reference, and then attach the new figure.


Converting from Figures to File Attachments
   You can move a linked file from the Figures field to the File Attachments field in a reference. Keep in mind
   that only figures stored in the Figure field can be inserted as graphics in Microsoft Word with Cite While You
   Write.

   Early versions of EndNote did not include a File Attachments field. You may have linked a file to the
   Figure field in the past, and now would prefer to have the file linked to the File Attachments field.

   To convert file links from the Figures field to the File Attachments field:

      1. In Reference List, highlight the reference(s) you wish to change.

      2. Select Figure > Convert Figures to File Attachments from the References menu.


Storing and Sharing Figure Files
   When you insert a figure, EndNote copies the figure file and places the copy in the .Data folder for your
   library, which is found in the same folder as the main library file. The copied figure file is specifically linked to
   a single EndNote reference.

    Note: Simply putting a figure file into the .Data folder does not link it to a reference. You must use the
    References > Figure > Attach Figure command.

   If you move your library to a different computer or if you want to share your library with someone, remember
   to always copy the .Data folder along with the library.


Linking References to Files and Web Sites
   EndNote includes a URL field and a File Attachments field that you can use to link URLs and local files to
   EndNote references.

   See the related topics below for details.

       ▪ Linking a URL to an EndNote Reference

       ▪ Linking a File to an EndNote Reference

       ▪ Selecting a Relative Path or an Absolute Path for File Attachments

       ▪ Removing a Linked File from File Attachments

       ▪ Opening a Linked File or URL

       ▪ Finding Full Text for a Reference



       Page 72 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


Linking a URL to an EndNote Reference
   The term "URL" stands for "Uniform Resource Locator" and is a common term for the "address" used to
   identify the location of an item online. Most often, URLs refer to Web pages, such as this example of the
   Clarivate Web page:

       https://clarivate.com/

   To link a URL to a reference in your EndNote library:

      1. Select a reference in the Reference List.

      2. Put your cursor in the URL field.

      3. Type or paste a valid URL into the field. EndNote will recognize URLs beginning with http://, https://,
         or ftp:// as valid URLs.

      4. The URL becomes a hyperlink (blue and underlined).

   For more information about linking to a URL, see The URL Field.


Linking a File to an EndNote Reference
   You can link a file on your computer—such as a PDF, a word processing document, or a spreadsheet file—
   to an EndNote reference.

   The File Attachments options are available only when a single reference is selected in the Library window or
   when you are editing a reference.

   To link a file to the File Attachments field in a reference:

      1. Select a reference in the Reference List.

      2. From the References menu, select File Attachments > Attach File.

      3. On the file dialog, select a file to link to the selected reference.

          Note the checkbox along the bottom titled, "Copy this file to the default file attachments folder and
          create a relative link." This gives you the option to:

           ▪ Select the checkbox to copy the original file and place the copy in the .Data\PDF folder that is
              part of your EndNote library. Files in the .Data folder will sync and can be shared.

           ▪ Deselect the checkbox to always have EndNote look in the original folder for the inserted file.
              Files that are in their original locations, not in the .Data folder, will not be synced and cannot be
              shared. If the original file is moved, the link will break and you will not be able to open it from
              EndNote.

          For more information about this option, see Selecting a Relative Path or an Absolute Path for File
          Attachments.

      4. Click Open.

   EndNote will display an icon indicating the type of file inserted. You can insert up to 45 files into the File
   Attachments field.

       Page 73 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


    Note: Another way to link a file to the File Attachments field is to drag and drop the file onto the reference
    in the Reference List or the Reference panel. Whether the file is saved with the database or is linked with
    an absolute path is determined by the default file attachment setting. See URLs and Links Preferences.


    Note: Never rename attached files within the DATA folder. EndNote assigns each file a unique name that
    helps link it to a specific reference.


    Note: In order to maintain cross-platform compatibility, any of the following characters in a filename will be
    replaced by an underscore when EndNote saves a copy of the file in the DATA\PDF folder with a relative
    path.


                 These characters are
             replaced with an underscore
               \      back slash
               /      forward slash
               :      colon
               *      asterisk
               ?      question mark
               "      quotation mark

               >      greater than
               |      vertical bar


Selecting a Relative Path or an Absolute Path for File Attachments
   When you link a file to the File Attachments field in a reference, you have the option of saving a relative path
   to the file or an absolute path to the file.

What is a Relative Path Versus an Absolute Path?

   When you insert a link to a file with the File Attachments > Attach File command from the References menu,
   the file dialog includes a checkbox titled, "Copy this file to the default file attachments folder and create a
   relative link."

Relative Path (checkbox selected)

   When this checkbox is selected, EndNote makes a copy of the original file and places it in the .Data\PDF
   folder that is part of your EndNote library. This saves the file as a "portable link" that can move as part of the
   library. EndNote will always be able to access the file, even when you share your library with a colleague
   through Library Sharing or by giving them a copy of your library files (always include the complete .Data
   folder along with the .enl file).

   File attachments stored in the .Data folder will sync and be included in libraries shared through the Library
   Sharing feature.

   If you edit the original file on your computer, those changes will not be reflected in EndNote. You would need
   to make the changes to the copy in your library or clear the file from your EndNote reference and reinsert




       Page 74 of 631
        Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


    the file. To make changes to the copy in your library, open the file in the default application for that file type
    by selecting File Attachments > Open File from the References menu.

Absolute Path (checkbox selected)

    When this checkbox is selected, EndNote will use the complete path and filename to look in the original
    folder for the inserted file. This can be helpful if you plan to edit the original file and you want those changes
    reflected when you access the file from within EndNote. However, if you ever move the file from the original
    folder, EndNote will not be able to access it unless you clear the file from your EndNote reference and
    reinsert it from the new folder location. If you send your library to a colleague, the file will not be available.

    File attachments outside the .Data folder will not sync and will not be shared through the Library Sharing
    feature.

How Can I Tell Which Type of Path Was Used?

In the Summary Panel

    At the top of the Summary panel you will see a list of attached files. Files showing only a file name are
    stored in the .Data\PDF folder and have relative links. Files showing path information are not stored in
    the .Data\PDF folder and have absolute links.

In the Edit Panel

    Go to the Edit panel for the reference, then scroll to the File Attachments field. Hold your mouse pointer over
    the file icon.

        ▪ If the file was linked with an absolute link, the file name will not include the .Data\PDF folder for your
           library.

        ▪ If the file was linked with a relative path, the file name will include the .Data\PDF folder for your
           library.

    You can also determine the type of path by previewing the File Attachments field. Use an output style such
    as Show All Fields, which includes the File Attachments field, or make your own custom style.
    See Introduction to Output Styles for information on creating custom styles. In the preview, file attachments
    appear as:




    Files with relative links in the .Data folder begin with "internal-pdf" while files with absolute links show a full
    path name.




        Page 75 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


Selecting a Default Setting for the Path

   Since you likely will want most of your linked files treated the same way, you can select a default setting for
   the "Copy this file to the default file attachments folder and create a relative link" checkbox. You can change
   the default setting from the Preferences panel. See URLs and Links Preferences.

   You still have the option to override the default setting each time you insert a file into the File Attachments
   field.

Converting Absolute Paths to Relative Paths

   If you are working with a library that was created with a version of EndNote prior to version X, all of your
   existing linked files are saved with absolute paths. You can easily change your absolute paths to relative
   paths, which will allow you to easily share your library, along with linked files, with colleagues.

   To convert absolute paths to relative paths:

      1. Before you begin, back up your EndNote library. This change cannot be reversed. You can find
         information on creating a compressed library as a backup at Saving a Compressed Copy of a
         Library.

      2. In the Reference List, select the references you wish to modify.

      3. From the References menu, select File Attachments > Convert to Relative Links.

   For each selected reference, EndNote locates each file linked in the File Attachments field and copies those
   files into the .Data\PDF folder for the library.

Inserting the Same File Again

   If you try to insert a link to the same filename again in the same reference, your results are different
   depending on whether you are inserting files with a relative path or an absolute path.

   Relative Path: The relative path always points to the library’s .Data\PDF folder. EndNote will attach the file
   again, giving it a new name.

   Absolute Path: Because you could have several absolute paths pointing to the same filename in different
   folders, it is possible to link to the same filename numerous times.


Removing a Linked File from File Attachments
   Before you remove a linked file, make sure you have a backup of the original file. This process cannot be
   undone. You can find information on creating library backups at Saving a Compressed Copy of a
   Library and Saving a Copy of a Library.

   To remove a linked file from the File Attachments field:

      1. Select the reference in the Reference List.

      2. In the Summary panel for the reference, select the drop-down list for the attachment you wish to
         remove, then select Delete from the list.

       OR



       Page 76 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


     3. In the Edit panel for the reference, scroll to the File Attachments field, select the drop-down list for
        the attachment you wish to remove, then select Delete from the list.

  If the file was linked with an absolute path, the File Attachments field no longer points to the file. The original
  file remains intact.

  If the file was linked with a relative path, that file is deleted from the library’s .Data\PDF folder, and the File
  Attachments field no longer points to it. You will not be able to reinsert the link unless you have the original
  file stored elsewhere on your computer.

     Note: See How Can I Tell Which Type of Path Was Used? for information on identifying relative or
     absolute links for files.


Saving a Copy of an Attached File
  Whether an attached file is saved with a relative path in a library’s .Data\PDF folder or with an absolute path
  to a specific location, you can save a copy of the attached file to any location.

  To save a copy of an attached file from the Reference panel:

     1. Select the reference in the Reference List.

     2. Select the Summary panel.

     3. Select the file attachment you want to copy.

     4. Select Save As… from the drop-down list.

     5. Use the file dialog to select a folder, enter a file name, then click Save to save the file.

  To save a copy of an attached file from the References menu:

     1. Select the reference in the Reference List.

     2. Select File Attachments > Save As… from the References menu.

     3. Use the file dialog to select a folder, enter a file name, then click Save to save the file.

   Note: From the References menu, if more than one file is attached to the reference, only the first one is
   saved to disk.


Opening a Linked File or URL
  Once a valid URL or file attachment appears in EndNote, you can use them to quickly access the linked web
  site or file.

      ▪ To open a URL in a selected reference, select URL > Open URL from the References menu. If there
         is more than one URL listed in the URL field, the first one listed will open.

      ▪ To open a file attachment in a selected reference, select File Attachments > Open from the
         References menu. If there is more than one file attachment, the first one listed will be opened.




      Page 77 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       ▪ If you have more than one file attachment in a selected reference and don't want to open the first
          one, go to the Summary panel, select the attachment you want to open, then select Open from the
          drop-down list.

   You must have the necessary program installed on your computer in order for EndNote to open a file
   created by another program. For example, to open a Word document file, you must have Microsoft Word or
   another program that can read Word files installed on your computer.

Using Keyboard Command Shortcuts

   Keyboard command shortcuts can also be used to open URLs and file attachments. The command shortcut
   for References > URL > Open URL is (Ctrl+G). The command shortcut for References > File Attachments >
   Open File is (Ctrl +Alt+P). Below are the expected actions for these commands.

       ▪ The Open URL command (Ctrl+G) opens the first URL listed in the selected reference’s URL field.

       ▪ The Open File command (Ctrl +Alt+P) opens the first linked file listed in the selected reference’s File
          Attachments field.

   If you need to enter multiple links into the URL field of one reference, enter them one per line. EndNote will
   open the first link in the field when you select Open URL. If you have multiple links, you can click on any one
   of them to activate the link. (We recommend that you enter multiple URLs on separate lines. However, if
   more than one URL is entered on a single line, separated by semicolons, hold down the Alt key while you
   click on the URL you wish to open.)


Renaming Attachments and PDF Files
   EndNote includes two options to rename your attached files from within EndNote:

       ▪ You can rename individual files, including PDFs, with custom names.

       ▪ You can have EndNote rename PDFs with new names based on EndNote fields, either one EndNote
          reference at a time or or an entire group of references at once.

Renaming Individual Attachments with Custom Names

   This method allows renaming any file type, not just PDFs, but must be applied to one attachment at a time.
   To rename a selected attachment with a name of your choice:

      1. In the Reference Summary or Edit panel, open the drop-down menu for the attached file you want to
         rename, and then select Rename Attachment… from the menu.

      2. In the Rename field, give the file a new name of less than 50 characters (remember to keep the
         extension part of the name intact), and then click the OK button to rename the file.

   The new file name for the attachment will appear in the EndNote record.

Renaming PDFs Based on EndNote Field Contents

   Along with being able to rename PDFs as you do other attachments using the method above, you can also
   have EndNote rename PDF file attachments based on data in the EndNote records they are attached to.
   This method can be applied to a single EndNote reference or the PDFs attached to multiple references.




       Page 78 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


    Note: This method will change the name for all PDF files attached to a record. If you have more than one
    PDF attached to a record, they will have the same name except for a number at the end of the name. The
    new name is not based on the contents of the PDF; it is based on the data in the EndNote record holding
    the PDF.


Renaming PDF Documents

      1. In the Reference Summary or Edit panel, open the drop-down menu for an attached PDF file you
         want to rename, and then select Rename PDFs… from the menu.

      2. Select up to three fields to use in renaming the PDF. EndNote will remember your field choices for
         future renaming of PDF files. (See below for a list of fields that cannot be used in renaming PDFs.)
         The format of the PDF filename is First Field, Second Field, Third Field.

          a. Choose First: EndNote uses the selected field as the first field in PDF filename. For example,
             by Author.

          b. Then: EndNote uses the selected field as the second field in the PDF filename. For example, by
             Year.

          c. Then: EndNote uses the selected field as the third field in the PDF filename. For example: by
             Title.

      3. Click the OK button to rename the PDF attachments for the reference.

    Note: Data must exist in a selected field in order for renaming to occur. If no data is available, then
    EndNote inserts a hyphen between selected fields that have data.


Renaming Multiple PDF Documents

   You can also rename multiple PDF documents attached to multiple references.

      1. Select one or more references that have attached PDF files.

      2. From the References menu, select File Attachments, and then select Rename PDFs....

      3. You will receive a warning message that this change cannot be undone, with a suggestion to backup
         the library first. Click OK to continue renaming the PDFs or Cancel to stop the process. See Saving a
         Compressed Copy of a Library and Saving a Copy of a Library for information on backing up
         EndNote Libraries.

      4. If you chose OK to continue renaming PDFs, select your field choices for renaming.

      5. Click the OK button to rename the files.

The Rename Options

   The Rename Options dialog allows you to select the fields used to rename your PDF attachments. You can
   select any field from the menu when renaming your PDF documents except the following fields.

       ▪ Figure

       ▪ File Attachments


       Page 79 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       ▪ Last Updated

       ▪ Rating

       ▪ Read Status
   You may use up to 50 characters to rename your PDF documents. This includes the period (.) and the
   filename extension. If a PDF that you are renaming exceeds the 50 character limit, then EndNote truncates
   the name of the PDF to meet the 50 character limit.

   See also PDF Handling Preferences.


Working with PDFs
Attaching PDF Files
   You can attach PDF files and view them in the PDF panel in various ways.

       ▪ Click the Attach File button near the File Attachments field in the Edit panel.

       ▪ Click the Attach File button near the File Attachments field in the Summary panel.

       ▪ If the reference has no attached PDFs, click the Attach PDF button in the PDF panel to open a
          Select File dialog.

       ▪ If the reference has attached PDFs, select Attach PDF… from the drop-down list in the PDF panel.




       ▪ Select a reference in the References List, select References > File Attachments > Attach File to
          open a select file dialog.

       ▪ Select a reference. Press Ctrl+Alt+A to open a select file dialog.
   Click the Save button in the Edit panel to save your work. You can also navigate to another reference and
   EndNote will prompt you to save your work.

   Note: Although the button to attach files is called Attach PDF, many file types can be attached to an
   EndNote record. If attaching another type of file, the file can be opened in its default application from the
   Reference Edit panel.

   To open a file attached to a reference in an application other than EndNote, select the Open
   with… button ( ), or select Edit in the Reference panel, navigate to the File Attachments field, and select
   the option to Open with… from the drop-down list. This will allow you to open attached files that are not
   PDFs in programs that can work with them. If opening a PDF, this will allow you to open it in a program
   other than EndNote.

   requirements for your document.



Artificial Intelligence (AI) in EndNote: The Research Assistant
   In EndNote 2025 Clarivate is introducing its first artificial intelligence (AI) feature for EndNote: The Research
   Assistant.

   For decades authors have provided abstracts for their journal articles summarizing the contents and key
   points of the article from the author's point of view. In contrast to this traditional summary of the article, the
   Research Assistant feature uses AI to independently analyze the contents of the journal article from its PDF
   and provide a short summary of the key points in the article. The Research Assistant feature can be found in
   EndNote and EndNote Web. Below is an example.

  Please note a PDF of the article must be attached to the EndNote reference to use the Research Assistant
  feature.



Changing Text in References
  Global editing commands make it easy to keep your reference data consistent.

      ▪ The Find and Replace command is available from the Library menu

      ▪ The Change/Move/Copy Fields command is available from the Library menu.
  The Find and Replace command searches for text in your library and either deletes that text or replaces it
  with other text that you specify. The Change Fields command modifies any field in your library by either
  inserting text at the beginning or end of the field, replacing all contents of the field with different text or
  deleting the contents of the field. The command moves the entire contents of a field to a different field.

   Note: Be sure that you have a current backup of your library; these operations cannot be undone with the
   Undo command. See Saving a Compressed Copy of a Library and Saving a Copy of a Library for
   information on creating a backup of your library.


Find and Replace, Change Field, and Move Field
  The Find and Replace, Change Field, and Move Field commands can be used to make changes to a large
  number of references at once. Here are some of the common uses for these commands.

      ▪ Correcting consistently misspelled words or names.
         Use the Find and Replace command from the Edit menu to search for the misspelled term and
         replace it with the correct spelling.

      ▪ Updating author’s names.
         There may be variations of an author’s name in your data. For example, "Joe Cool," "Joe A. Cool,"
         "J. A. Cool.," and so on. Since some styles prefer whole names and others abbreviated first and

      Page 84 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


         middle names, it is best to update names to full names and leave the work of abbreviating to the
         EndNote styles.

      ▪ Cleaning up your keywords.
         You can add a keyword to a group of references using Change Fields. Use Find and Replace to
         replace a term with a new one. If there is a keyword that you no longer want in your references, use
         Find and Replace to search for that text and replace it with nothing, thereby deleting it (you might
         also want to open your term list and delete it from there so that you do not use that term again).

      ▪ Dating or labeling a set of imported references.
         It can be useful to add the date or source of data to a batch of newly imported references. Only the
         imported references are "showing" in the Reference List after importing. At this point, use Change
         Fields to add a word or phrase to any field in just those references.

      ▪ Moving fields of information in a set of imported references.
         Maybe your import filter or connection file consistently sent Note information to the Abstract field.
         Use the Move Fields option to cut all information from the Abstract field and move it into the Notes
         field. Don’t forget to update your filter or connection file so it directs information to the correct field
         next time!


Find and Replace
  Use the Find and Replace command to find text in your references and replace it with other text. Changes
  can be restricted to a particular field in your references. You can also apply:

      ▪ Match Case and Match Words restrictions

      ▪ Style changes that include bold, italics, underline, plain text, superscript, subscript, or symbol font

   Caution: The Undo command from the Edit menu cannot undo the results of the Find and Replace
   command. Make sure you have a backup before making changes. See Saving a Compressed Copy of a
   Library and Saving a Copy of a Library for information on making a backup of your library.

  The Find and Replace command will only be applied to the references showing in the current Reference
  List. Use the following options to control which references are showing:

      ▪ Selecting the All References group will show all the references in the library and the change will be
         applied to any that match the Find and Replace criteria.

      ▪ Selecting a group will limit Find and Replace to only the references in that group.

      ▪ Performing a search in advance of Find and Replace will bring up a set of search results in the
         Reference List, allowing you to limit Find and Replace to the showing results. You can find detailed
         information on searching EndNote libraries in Searching EndNote References.

      ▪ If you wish to confine Find and Replace to a specific set of references that none of the methods
         above will provide, create a custom group and put all the references you want to use with Find and
         Replace in that group, then select that group to show only those references. You can find information
         on creating custom groups in Creating a Custom Group.

  To use Find and Replace to replace text in your references:


      Page 85 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


     1. After using one of the options above to limit the references in the Reference List to show only those
        you want to change, select Find and Replace from the Library menu.

     2. From the Select a Field list, select the field to be searched.

     3. In the Find text box, type the text you wish to change. To enter a Carriage Return or Tab in the text
        box, use the Insert Special button.

     4. Change the Match Case or Match Words settings, if necessary.

         By default, the Match Words option is always selected. If you change this setting, pay close attention
         to whether or not the term you are changing could appear as part of another word or in a different
         context depending on the capitalization.

     5. In the Replace with text box, type the text that should replace the original text. To enter a Carriage
        Return or Tab in the text box, use the Insert Special button.

         Select the Retain Capitalization option to maintain the same capitalization as the text being replaced.

         Retain Capitalization should be selected if replacing a term that might appear with different
         capitalization. For example, any word may have its first letter capitalized if it is the first word in a title,
         but may also appear in all lowercase in other places. Do not select Retain Capitalization if you are
         replacing an acronym with its unabbreviated version.

  Click the Change button to search the selected references for the specified text and replace it with the new
  text. Before replacing any text, EndNote has you verify the changes.

  Click OK if all of those items in the dialog are correct. EndNote replaces the text and displays the number of
  references that were changed.


Change Fields
  The Change Fields command allows you to change the contents of a field for the references that are
  showing in the Reference List.

   Caution: You cannot undo the Change Fields operation. Once you perform this operation, EndNote
   changes the data in the selected field in all the references in the showing Reference List. We recommend
   that you make a backup copy of your library before making changes. See Saving a Compressed Copy of
   a Library and Saving a Copy of a Library for information on making a backup of your library.

  The Change Fields command will only be applied to the references showing in the current Reference List.
  Use the following options to control which references are showing:

      ▪ Selecting the All References group will show all the references in the library and the change will be
         applied to any that match the Change Fields criteria.

      ▪ Selecting a group will limit Change Fields to only the references in that group.

      ▪ Performing a search in advance of Change Fields will bring up a set of search results in the
         Reference List, allowing you to limit Change Fields to the showing results. You can find detailed
         information on searching EndNote libraries in Searching EndNote References.

      ▪ If you wish to confine Change Fields to a specific set of references that none of the methods above
         will provide, create a custom group and put all the references you want to use with Move/Copy in


      Page 86 of 631
    Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       that group, then select that group to show only those references. You can find information on
       creating custom groups in Creating a Custom Group.

To change the contents of a field:

After using one of the options above to limit the references in the Reference List to show only those you
want to change, select Change/Move/Copy Fields from the Library menu.

From the Select a Field list, select the field that you want to modify.

   1. Select one of the following options:

        ▪ Insert after field’s text appends text at the end of the chosen field. It does not modify the text
           already in the field.

           By default, when you select this option, the "Include a space before the new text" checkbox is
           selected at the bottom of the dialog, to insert a space between the existing text and the new text.

           You could also use the Insert Special button to insert a carriage return before the new text. If you
           do this, unmark Include a space before the new text to avoid having both a space and a carriage
           return.

        ▪ Insert before field’s text inserts the text at the beginning of the chosen field. It does not modify
           text that is already in the field.

           By default, when you select this option, the "Include a space after the new text" checkbox is
           selected at the bottom of the dialog, to insert a space between the new text and the existing text.

           You could also use the Insert Special button to insert a carriage return after the new text. If you
           do this, unmark Include a space after the new text to avoid having both a space and a carriage
           return.

        ▪ Replace whole field with replaces the entire contents of the field with the text entered in the text
           box.

        ▪ Clear field deletes the entire contents of the chosen field. You cannot enter text in the text box.

        ▪ Change Case applies new case formatting to the entire contents of a field. Options include:
           Sentence case, lowercase, UPPERCASE, Every Word, and tOGGLE cASE. You cannot enter
           text in the text box.

   2. In the text box, type the text that you want to add to the field. To enter a Carriage Return or Tab in the
      text box, use the Insert Special button.

   3. Select (highlight) the text that you entered in the text box, and then select a font style: Bold, Italics,
      Underline, Plain, Superscript, or Subscript, or Symbol Font. This is optional.

   4. Click the OK button. EndNote will ask you to confirm the changes. The dialog EndNote presents
      provides this information:

        ▪ How many references will be changed

        ▪ The library in which the changes will be made

        ▪ The type of change that will be made


    Page 87 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


     5. Click OK to continue with the changes or click Cancel to cancel the operation.


Move/Copy Fields
  The Move/Copy Fields command allows you to move and copy field data. Both commands apply to all of the
  references that are showing in the Reference List.

  The Move Fields option allows you to move the entire contents of one field to another field within a
  reference. All data, including any formatting that you applied to the source field, is moved to the destination
  field.

   Caution: You cannot undo the Move operation. Once you perform this operation, EndNote removes the
   source field from all the references in the Reference List. We recommend that you make a backup copy of
   your library before making changes. See Saving a Compressed Copy of a Library and Saving a Copy of a
   Library for information on making a backup of your library.

  The Copy option allows you to copy the entire contents of one field to another field within a reference. Both
  the source field and the destination field will contain the same data. All data retains any formatting that you
  applied to the source field and to the destination field.

  The Move/Copy Fields command will only be applied to the references showing in the current Reference
  List. Use the following options to control which references are showing:

      ▪ Selecting the All References group will show all the references in the library and the change will be
         applied to any that match the Move/Copy criteria.

      ▪ Selecting a group will limit Move/Copy to only the references in that group.

      ▪ Performing a search in advance of Move/Copy will bring up a set of search results in the Reference
         List, allowing you to limit Move/Copy to the showing results. You can find detailed information on
         searching EndNote libraries in Searching EndNote References.

      ▪ If you wish to confine Move/Copy to a specific set of references that none of the methods above will
         provide, create a custom group and put all the references you want to use with Move/Copy in that
         group, then select that group to show only those references. You can find information on creating
         custom groups in Creating a Custom Group.

  To move/copy the contents of one field to another:

     1. After using one of the options above to limit the references in the Reference List to show only those
        you want to change, select Change/Move/Copy Fields from the Library menu.

     2. Select the Move/Copy Fields tab.

     3. In the dialog that appears:

         ▪ Select the Move Field radio button to move information to another field.

         ▪ Select the Copy Field radio button to copy information to another field.
     4. Use the From list to select the source field from which you want to move or copy the data.

     5. Use the To list to select the destination field to which you want to move or copy the data.

     6. Select one of the following options:

      Page 88 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


          ▪ Insert after field's text (the default option).

          ▪ Insert before field's text.

          ▪ Replace entire field.
     7. Click OK to move or copy the data from one field to another field within each reference in the
        showing Reference List. Click Cancel to stop the operation.

   Caution: When using the Move option, you have the choice of inserting the moved text before or after the
   data in the destination field or replacing the entire contents of the destination field. If replacing the entire
   field, you have the additional option of whether or not to move empty fields. If you clear the "Don’t move
   empty fields" checkbox, then any reference with an empty originating field deletes the contents of the
   corresponding destination field (thereby making it empty as well). If this option is marked (turned on), the
   contents of the destination field will not be deleted if the originating field is empty.



Checking Spelling
Spell Check
  EndNote's Spell Check can check the spelling of one reference at a time.

  If text is highlighted in the active reference, that selection is checked first, and then you are prompted to
  check the rest of the reference.

  EndNote’s spell checker can check spelling accuracy in all fields except the Author fields (Author,
  Secondary Author, Tertiary Author, Subsidiary Author, and Translated Author) and the URL, Figure, and File
  Attachments fields.

  To start spell checking:

     1. Select the Edit panel of the reference you wish to check.

     2. (Optional) If you want to check only a portion of the text, highlight only that text.

     3. Right-click within the Edit panel, then select Spell Check from the drop-down menu, or select Spell
        Check from the Library menu, or press Ctrl+Y on the keyboard.

  If EndNote finds a word that is not found in the selected dictionaries, it displays a Check Spelling dialog.

   Note: The Spell Check option under the Library menu will only be available when in the Edit panel.

  The Check Spelling dialog works just like a spell checker in a word processor. For a complete description of
  each button in the dialog, see Check Spelling Dialog.



Check Spelling Dialog
  The Check-Spelling Dialog appears if a word requiring your attention is detected. You can use the dialog to
  specify whether the word should be ignored or replaced. Descriptions of how the various parts of the dialog
  work are below.



      Page 89 of 631
    Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


 Note: The labels of some buttons and text boxes in the dialog change according to the context.


 Note: If you are unable to add dictionaries, or to add words to or edit dictionaries, it is probably because
 your Windows security settings are preventing you from making changes in the \\Program Files (x86)
 folder. The best option is to copy the C:\Program Files (x86)\EndNote 2025\Spell folder and all its
 contents to another location, then load the dictionary files from that location. This should allow you to
 make changes to the files or create your own dictionary files.

The Check Spelling dialog includes the following options:

    ▪ Add button: Causes the reported word to be added to the dictionary selected in the Add Words To
       list. Use the Add button if a correctly spelled word you use often is reported as a misspelling (for
       example, your family name). If the word is not used frequently, you may want to select the Ignore or
       Ignore All buttons instead. This button is enabled only if a user dictionary has been selected in the
       Add Words To list.

    ▪ Add Words To list: Indicates which user dictionary words will be added to when you select the Add
       button. The Add Words To list shows all user dictionaries currently open. You can open or close other
       dictionaries via the Dictionaries dialog, which is accessible by selecting the Dictionaries button.

    ▪ Cancel button: Stops the current spelling check.

    ▪ Capitalization box: Contains an uncapitalized word that exists in the dictionaries in capitalized form
       only. You can edit the word in this box or select a suggestion from the list, then click the Change
       button to correct the word, or click the Ignore button to skip the word.

    ▪ Change button: Causes the reported word to be replaced. If the problem word was edited, the
       edited word is used as the replacement. Otherwise, the selected suggestion is used as the
       replacement. Only this occurrence of the reported word is replaced. If you want this and all following
       occurrences of the word replaced, select the Change All button.

    ▪ Change All button: Causes this and all following occurrences of the reported word to be replaced. If
       the problem word was edited, the edited word is used as the replacement. Otherwise, the selected
       suggestion is used as the replacement. If you want only this occurrence of the word to be replaced,
       use the Change button. If the reported word is one you frequently misspell, you might consider
       adding it to a user dictionary via the Dictionaries dialog. You can display the Dictionaries dialog by
       selecting the Dictionaries button.

    ▪ Consider Changing box: Contains a word which may be misspelled or otherwise incorrect, and is
       presented with a candidate replacement word. You can change the word by selecting the Change
       button, or skip it by selecting the Ignore button.

    ▪ Delete button: Removes the word from the text. This button appears when a doubled word has
       been detected, or when the contents of the problem-word box are deleted.

    ▪ Dictionaries button: Causes the Dictionaries dialog to be displayed. You can use the Dictionaries
       dialog to open or close user dictionaries, and to edit the contents of user dictionaries.

    ▪ Ignore button: Causes this occurrence of a misspelled word to be skipped. If the same misspelled
       word appears later, it will be reported again.

    ▪ Ignore All button: Causes this and all further occurrences of a misspelled word to be skipped. You
       might use this button if the word reported as a misspelling is actually spelled correctly. If the word is
       one you use frequently, you may wish to ignore it permanently by selecting the Add button.


    Page 90 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      ▪ Not in dictionary box: Indicates that a misspelled word was detected. The word is considered
         misspelled because it could not be located in any open dictionaries, or was marked with an exclude
         action. You can edit the word in this box or select a suggestion from the list, then click the Change
         button to correct the word, or click the Ignore button to skip the word.

      ▪ Options button: Displays the Options dialog. You can use the Options dialog to set spelling-checker
         options.

      ▪ Suggest button: Search more thoroughly for suggested replacements for the current misspelled
         word. Each time you click the Suggest button, a "deeper" search is made. The Suggest button is
         disabled once all possible suggestions have been located.

      ▪ Suggestions list: Contains a list of suggested replacements for the word reported as misspelled.
         Subsequent presses of the Suggest button may yield more suggestions. The word selected in the
         Suggestions list will be used as the replacement when the Change or Change All buttons are
         pressed, unless the word in the problem box was edited.

      ▪ Undo Edit button: Remove any changes made to the text in the problem box. This button appears
         only if the text in the problem box has been changed.


Spell Check Options and Dictionaries
  You can access Spell Check Options and Dictionaries in two ways:

      ▪ From the Edit menu, select Preferences, then Spell Check.

      ▪ Start Spell Check. When EndNote detects a misspelled word, the Check Spelling dialog appears. An
         Options button and a Dictionaries button are available on the dialog.

   Note: If you are unable to add dictionaries, or to add words to or edit dictionaries, it is probably because
   your Windows security settings are preventing you from making changes in the \\Program Files (x86)
   folder. The best option is to copy the C:\Program Files (x86)\EndNote 2025\Spell folder and all its
   contents to another location, then load the dictionary files from that location. This should allow you to
   make changes to the files or create your own dictionary files.

  For information about the Spell Check Options and Dictionaries preferences, including a list of dictionaries
  supplied with EndNote, see Spell Check Preferences.


Reverting References
  The Revert Reference command undoes (reverts) all changes made to a reference since it was last opened
  or saved. Revert Reference is not available after you close the reference.

  To revert changes, right-click in the Edit panel, then select Revert Reference from the list.

  To remove the very last change made to a reference, use the Undo (Ctrl+Z) command in the Edit menu
  before leaving the field.




      Page 91 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide



Compare and Restore Previous Versions of a Reference
  If you discover an error was made in a reference or it was accidentally changed, but the reference has
  already been saved so the Reverting References function is not available, you can restore the reference
  from a prior version available through the online copy of the Synced library. This feature is only available if
  you are Syncing your EndNote library to EndNote Web/online.

  To access the previous version of the reference:

     1. Select the reference in the EndNote library.

     2. Select Edit in the Reference panel.

     3. Click the Compare versions button.

     4. Select the date you want to compare the reference against from the drop-down list.




     5. Scroll through the window, comparing the reference in your current library at the left with the earlier
        reference from your online library at the right. If you wish to change to another comparison date, you
        can select it from the drop-down list.

     6. When you find the version of the reference you want to keep from the online library, click the Use this
        version button. If you decide you do not want to restore the reference from an earlier version, click
        the Close button.



Cut, Copy, and Paste Text in References
  The Cut, Copy, and Paste commands in the Edit menu can be used to move text from one field in a
  reference to another field by selecting and copying or cutting the text and then pasting it in the desired
  location. You can also Copy and Paste text from a field in an EndNote reference to your word processor.
  Similarly, you can Copy text from a word-processing document and Paste it into a reference. If it is important
  to paste the text along with the fonts and text styles, use the Paste with Text Styles command in the Edit
  menu. The regular Paste command does not include font, size, or text style information when pasting into
  EndNote from another program. Avoid pasting unwanted fonts and text styles into EndNote references
  because those fonts and text styles will carry through into future bibliographies.


Using Drag-and-Drop Within a Reference
  Text may be moved within a reference by selecting the text in the Edit panel, and then dragging and
  dropping it in a new location.

   Note: When text is moved this way within a reference, it is moved from one location to another. When it is
   dragged from a reference in one library to a reference in another library, or to another program (such as
   your word processor), the text is moved to the target reference and removed from the original location.


      Page 92 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


  To drag-and-drop text:

     1. Select the text to be moved.

     2. Click on the selection, and keep the mouse button pressed while you drag the text to another
        location. When the cursor is positioned in the right place, release the mouse button to drop the text in
        the selected location.


Copying and Pasting Complete References
  In addition to copying and pasting text between fields, EndNote can Copy and Paste entire references
  between libraries.


Copying References Using the Copy and Paste Commands

     1. Select one or more references in the Reference List (hold down the Ctrl key to select multiple
        references or the Shift key to select a range of references).

     2. Select Copy from the Edit menu and those references are copied to the Clipboard.

     3. Open another EndNote library and select Paste from the Edit menu. The references you copied are
        pasted into the library and sorted correctly with the existing references.


Copying References Using Drag-and-Drop
  An easy way to copy references between libraries is to use the drag-and-drop functionality. Simply select the
  references you want to copy, click on any part of the selection, and use the mouse to drag them to another
  open library. Release the mouse button when the cursor is over the destination library, and all of the
  selected references will be copied into the library.

  If you need to copy all of the references in one library to another library, you can also use the Import
  command to import one library into the other.

   Note: Any time you copy a reference and paste it into another library or import a reference into another
   library, the reference is assigned a new record number in the destination library.



Copy References To
  The Copy Reference To command allows copying a set of references to an EndNote library of your choice.

  From the References menu, select Copy References To. You will have these options:

      ▪ New Library: This will create a new library and copy the selected references into it.

      ▪ Choose Library: This will allow you to choose an EndNote library on your computer and copy the
         references into it. The library does not need to be open in EndNote. When the references are copied
         into it, the library you chose will be opened and display the copied references in a Copied
         References group.




      Page 93 of 631
Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


▪ [YourCurrentLibraryName].enl: The third option will only appear when you have selected
  references from online search results. It will show the name of the library you are currently working in
  and will allow you to copy the references from your online search results into your current library.

      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide




Searching EndNote References
  EndNote provides Search features that enable you to locate specific references or groups of references. For
  example, you can select a very general search, one that scans the entire library; or you can limit your
  searches to specific fields (such as the Author or Keywords fields). You can also create more complex
  searches using a variety of operators such as And, Or, Not, Greater than, Less than, and others.

  You can use the Search panel to search EndNote libraries as well as remote databases that are available
  online. See Searching Online Databases for information about online database searches.


The Simple Search Panel
  The default Simple Search panel allows you to quickly search your entire library (and PDFs and PDF Notes)
  by typing a word or phrase into the single text box. EndNote executes a general search of all fields.




  EndNote uses an implied AND Boolean operator when you enter two or more adjacent terms in Simple
  Search. For example, entering rainbow trout fish farm is equivalent to entering rainbow AND trout AND
  fish AND farm.

  Use double quotation marks (" ") to search for exact phrases and to override the implied AND Boolean
  operator.

  If you need to perform a more specific or complicated search, click the Advanced Search button to
  access The Advanced Search Panel.


The Advanced Search Panel
  The Advanced Search panel offers far more control over your EndNote search, using Boolean
  operator and comparison options, as well as abilities to save search strategies and reload saved search
  strategies.


Search Line
  A search line includes a Logical operator, the field to be searched from the Field list, the Comparison
  operator, and a blank field in which you enter your search terms. Use the plus or close (X) buttons to the
  right of each search line to insert or delete a line. You can have up to ten lines in your search.




      Page 95 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide




Boolean Operators List
   The AND, OR, and NOT operators between the search lines indicate how the search lines are to be
   combined. See Combining Search Lines with AND, OR, and NOT Operators.


Field List
   The Field list allows you to restrict your search to a particular field—such as Author, Year, or Keywords—
   or expand it to Any Field. By default, the Field lists are set to search Author, then Year, then Title. You can
   change the default search strategy by setting the operators, fields, and comparison terms you want to use
   for your new default strategy, then selecting Set Default from the Search Options drop-down menu.

   You can also restrict your search to PDF files attached to references by selecting the PDF option from the
   field list. The Any Field + PDF with Notes option allows you to search any field within a reference and all
   PDF files in the selected group that you are searching.

   See Restricting Searches to Specific Fields for more information.


Comparison List
   Select an item from the Comparison list to indicate how the search term should relate to the field(s) being
   searched. For example, you can find references in which:

       ▪ The Journal field begins with the term "science."

       ▪ The Journal field contains "science" anywhere in the field.

       ▪ The full Journal name is "science."
   See Using Comparison Operators for more information.


Search Fields
   The search term is the word or phrase that you want to locate in a reference. Enter your search terms in one
   or more search fields. Search terms can be typed or pasted into the fields. For special search items, such as
   tab or paragraph break characters, try copying and pasting them from Notepad. Copying from Notepad
   assures special characters will be copied without extra formatting.




       Page 96 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


Asterisk (*) Wildcard
   Expand your library retrieval results by adding wildcards before and after search terms. The asterisk
   represents any group of characters.

       ▪ Fields and PDF files can be searched using the asterisk wildcard.

       ▪ No minimum character length is required.

    Note: EndNote automatically applies left- and right-hand truncation to your search terms. So, by default,
    searching for "look" would find "look," "looking," or "outlook." However, you can still use the asterisk (*)
    wildcard before and after a search term, if you prefer.


Save Search and Load Search
   If you frequently use the same search strategies on the Search panel, you can use the Search Options
   menu to save these searches and later load them when you need them. See Saving Search Strategies.


Set Default and Restore Default
   Use the Search Options drop-down menu and select Set Default to save the configuration of all of the items
   on the Search panel except for the search terms. Use the Search Options drop-down menu and select
   Restore Default at any time to return the original configuration. See Saving Search Strategies.


Searching a Group, Group Set, or Tag
   You can limit your search to a specific group or group set of references, or a specific set of tagged
   references.

   To search a group, group set, or tag:

      1. Select the group, group set, or tag. The Reference List will change to display only the references in
         that group, group set, or tag.

      2. Select either the Simple Search or Advanced Search panel.

      3. Enter your search strategy and click Search.


Restricting Searches to Specific Fields
   Use the Field list on the Advanced Search panel to narrow your search to a specific field. You can select
   Any Field to look for your search terms in any of the fields in your references.

   For example, to find references published in 2013, restrict the search to the Year field to avoid finding
   entries that include 2013 in the abstract, title, or elsewhere.

   The field names in the Field list are EndNote’s "generic" field names. For example, Author represents
   Reporter, Editor, Artist, or any other variations of the Author field used in the different reference types.
   See The Generic Reference Type for a complete list of generic field names. To find the generic name that




       Page 97 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   matches a field for a specific reference type, select that reference type from the List of Reference Types or
   by selecting it from the Modify Reference Types dialog.

   To access the Modify Reference Types dialog:

      1. From the Edit menu, select Preferences.

      2. Click the Reference Types option in the list of preferences.

      3. Click the Modify Reference Types button and the Modify Reference Types dialog will open.

   EndNote can import references from hundreds of sources, each of which uses its own set of field names.
   Once you have transferred references into EndNote, you will search for information by using the destination
   EndNote generic field names, and not the original field names from the information provider. For example,
   the PMID number, when importing data from PubMed, typically transfers into the Accession Number field in
   EndNote. To search for a specific PMID in EndNote, search the Accession Number field.


Searching Fields and PDF Files
   You can search all fields, the attached PDF files, and added PDF notes in your selected Reference List.

      1. Select the Any Field + PDF with Notes option from the Field list.

      2. Select an item from the Comparison list to indicate how the search term(s) should relate to the
         search.

      3. Enter the search term(s) that you want to locate.

      4. Click the Search button.

   The following rules apply when you select the PDF option or the Any Field + PDF with Notes from the Field
   list.

       ▪ By default, EndNote ignores capitalization when searching for text. For example, a search for the
          term hospital also finds Hospital.

       ▪ If you enter a phrase, EndNote retrieves references that contain the words you entered in any field or
          in a PDF file. The words appear together if they are in any EndNote field or any PDF file. For
          example the query, hospital care retrieves references containing the term "hospital care" in either a
          field or a PDF file.

       ▪ When using the Advanced Search panel, EndNote searches quotation marks (" ") as characters
          when you select a specific field, the PDF option, or the Any Field + PDF with Notes option. For
          example, the query “poured cold water” only retrieves references that contain the phrase showing
          within a set of quotation marks somewhere in the reference, a linked PDF file, or within a Sticky
          Note. The phrase without quotation marks would be ignored in Advanced Search.


Rules for Single Word Searching
   When searching for a single word in any field using the Contains comparison operator, EndNote applies
   both left- and right-hand truncation. For example, the term plant finds:

      Plant
      plant
      plant classification

       Page 98 of 631

      planter
      "plant"
      transplant


Combining Search Lines with AND, OR, and NOT
Operators
  You can combine search lines on the Search panel with the Boolean operators AND, OR, and NOT to
  produce the following effects:

      ▪ AND finds references that match the preceding search line(s) and the following search line.
         AND narrows search results.

         Example: A search for parrot AND corvid finds only those references that mention both terms.

      ▪ OR finds references that match either the preceding search line(s) or following search term.
         OR broadens the search.

         Example: A search for parrot OR corvid finds all references that include either term.

      ▪ NOT finds all references containing the preceding term(s) and then omits references that contain the
         subsequent term. NOT narrows search results.

         Example: A search for parrot Not corvid finds all references including parrot, excluding any parrot
         references that mentioned corvid.

  You can use the Boolean operators (AND, OR and NOT) in sequence with as many as ten search lines to
  build your search strategy.


A Strategy Tip for the AND, OR, and NOT Operators
  Items in combination searches are executed from the top field to the bottom field of the Search panel. If you
  will be mixing the AND, OR, and NOT operators in your search, you will generally get the best results by
  following this strategy:

     1. Use the OR operator first, to broaden the search.

     2. Use the AND operator next, to narrow the search.

     3. Use the NOT operator last, to exclude items from the search.




  For example, in the search strategy shown above, EndNote will try to find any reference in the Reference
  List that contains either parrot or corvid in any field, but those references must also contain 2008 in the year




      Page 99 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


  field, and cannot have the term bat in any field. In this search of the sample library, five references were
  found.

  However, with the search below twenty-three references were found. This was because instead of
  broadening the search first with the OR operator, then narrowing (refining) it with the AND operator, this
  search first narrowed the search with the AND operator and then broadened it with the OR operator,
  producing poor results.




Using Comparison Operators
Comparison Operators
  The "comparison operators" are used to indicate how the search term relates to the chosen field in that
  search line. For example, if you have a search line that looks like this:

                             Comparison
          Field                                Search Term
                             Operator
          Title              Contains          parrot

  You will be searching for references where the Title (the search field) contains (the comparison operator)
  parrot (the search term).

  The comparison operators function as follows:

      ▪ Contains: Finds all references where the search field includes the search term. The search term
         includes both left and right truncation, so a search for "house" would find "house," "greenhouse," and
         "household" anywhere in the field.

        Note: Only the "Contains" comparison operator is available when searching online databases. The
        following operators are available only for searching the EndNote library. Please note that some
        operators may not work together with some options selected from the Field list.


      ▪ Is: finds all references in which the entire content of the search field is exactly the same as the
         search term.

        Note: This operator does not work in searches where you select the Any Field + PDF with
        Notes option from the Field list.


      ▪ Is Less Than: finds all references in which the search term is less than the contents of the search
         field.

      ▪ Is Less Than or Equal To: finds all references in which the search term is less than or identical to
         the contents of the search field.

      Page 100 of 631
Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


▪ Is Greater Than: finds all references in which the search term is greater than the contents of the
  search field.

▪ Is Greater Than or Equal To: finds all references in which the search term is greater than or
  identical to the contents of the search field.

  Note: For all of the Greater Than and Less Than comparisons, the comparison is either numerical
  or alphabetical based on the nature of the term. When the fields have both numbers and letters,
  numbers are considered less than letters, and empty fields are ignored.


▪ Field Begins With: finds all references in which the search term is found at the beginning of the
  selected field (also referred to as right field truncation). The search term can be a partial word, a full
  word, or several words, and will be compared to the initial text in the field. If you enter more than a
  single word, remember that punctuation and spaces are significant, so you must enter exactly what
  is found in the reference.

  Note: This operator does not work in searches where you select the Any Field + PDF with
  Notes option from the Field list.


▪ Field Ends With: finds all references in which the search term is found at the end of the field (also
  referred to as left field truncation). The search term can be a partial word, a full word, or several
  words, and will be compared to the ending text in the field. If you enter more than a single word,
  remember that punctuation and spaces are significant, so you must enter exactly what is found at the
  end of the field.

  Note: This operator does not work in searches where you select the Any Field + PDF with
  Notes option from the Field list.


▪ Word Begins With: finds all references in which the search term is found at the beginning of a word
  anywhere in the field (also referred to as right word truncation). Punctuation and spaces are ignored.
  This can help you find words that start with the same root. For example, searching for a word that
  begins with "land," would also find "landing" and "landfill," but not "Iceland" or "island."

  Note: The Field begins with, Field ends with, and Word begins with comparisons all treat Author
  fields like any other field. There is no manipulation of surnames and first names; EndNote looks at
  the literal string of text in the field.

Search Command Tips
Canceling Searches
  Pressing Esc cancels a search in progress.


Finding Tabs and Carriage Returns
  For special search items, such as tab or paragraph break characters, try copying and pasting them from
  Notepad. Copying from Notepad assures special characters will be copied without extra formatting.




      Page 102 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


Searching for Numbers
   When you search for a number, EndNote looks for that exact text string in your reference text. For example,
   a search on "Any Field" which "Contains" the search text "0025" will match the numbers 00025 and 0025,
   but it will not match 25.

   There is an exception for record numbers. Record numbers, which are assigned by EndNote, cannot include
   leading zeros. When you search Any Field for a number, EndNote looks for an exact match in all text fields;
   however, leading zeros are stripped from your search text before comparing it to record numbers. Only an
   exact match of a record number will be returned. So, a search of the Record Number field for "0025" will
   match record number 25. It will not match record number 250.


Searching for Dates Records Were Added to the Library or Updated
   Although EndNote displays the dates records were added to the library or last updated in local time, the
   dates recorded in the library will be set to the UTC time zone (Coordinated Universal Time, formerly
   Greenwich Mean Time), which means the dates remain consistent within the program when a person moves
   from one time zone to another, even though the dates displayed change. This can affect search results.

   For example, if a record was added to the library at 10:00 p.m. Pacific Time on April 1, 2025, it would be
   internally recorded as being added at 5:00 a.m. UTC on April 2, 2025. This means a user located in
   California would see the April 1 date displayed in their library because they were located in the Pacific Time
   zone, but if they searched for records added to the library only on April 1, 2025, the record would not be
   found.

   Similarly, if a record was added to the library at 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time on April 1, 2025, it would be
   internally recorded as being added at 8:00 p.m. UTC on March 31, 2025. This means a user located in
   California would still see the April 1 date displayed in their library because they were located in the Pacific
   Time zone, but if they searched for records added to the library only on April 1, 2025, the record would again
   not be found.

   However, if they built the search below, the record would be found because it would include all the UTC
   times for any record displaying the April 1, 2025 date locally in California, even if the UTC date for that
   record was not April 1, 2025.

                      Added to Library    Is greater than or equal to    4/1/2025
        Or            Added to Library    Is less than or equal to       4/2/2025


Author Fields
   The field names in the Field list are EndNote’s "Generic" field names, which means that Author represents
   Reporter, Editor, Artist, or any other variations of the Author field used in the different reference types.

   If you wish to search for author initials, make sure to include a space between the first and second initial.
   For example:

         Smith, J P

   If you do not include a space between initials, EndNote will assume that JP is a complete first name.




       Page 103 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


The Year Field
   When searching in the Year field, a search for "1994" retrieves only references published in 1994, whereas
   a search for "94" retrieves references from the 1940s and 1994.


Finding Empty Fields
   EndNote can search for empty fields. Select the desired field from the Field list, select "Is" as the
   comparison operator, and leave the search term blank. Click Search and EndNote finds references in which
   the chosen field is blank.


Finding File Attachments
   You can easily search for a specific file attachment by name. Search for:

                    File Attachments      Contains                       [name of the file]

   To search for all references that include file attachments, enter these two search lines:

                    Record Number         Is greater than or equal to    1
        Not         File Attachments      Is                             [blank]


   The first line ensures that all references are searched and gives EndNote something to apply the NOT
   command against, and the second line looks for references in which the File Attachments field is not blank.

    Note: Another easy way to see references with file attachments is to click on the paper clip header in the
    Library window to sort those references at the top of the list of references.


Setting and Restoring Defaults for the Advanced Search Panel
   Use the Search Options drop-down and select Set Default to save the current configuration of the Search
   panel as your default. The default configuration will appear whenever you first display the Advanced Search
   panel.

   The layout of the window (such as the number of search lines) is saved, as are all of the operators and field
   names. The search terms are not saved.

   Use the Search Options drop-down and select Restore Default to clear out all of the search terms currently
   entered in the Search panel, and reset all of the settings back to the default configuration.


Saving Search Strategies
   The Save Search and Load Search commands on the Search Options drop-down menu allow you to
   save the settings currently on the Search panel and recall them for later use. Most of the options on the
   Search panel are saved, including the search terms; however, the target of the search (the EndNote library
   or online database) is not saved.

   To save a search:



       Page 104 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


     1. Configure the Search panel.

     2. From the Search Options drop-down select Save Search.

     3. A dialog appears, prompting you to name the search strategy. Enter the name and click Save. The
        search      files   are     saved      by    default   in     the     C:\Users\[YourProfileName]
        \AppData\Roaming\EndNote\Searches folder. You may save them elsewhere if you prefer, but
        EndNote will open to this Searches folder when you choose to Load a saved search. (Note that the
        AppData folder is a hidden folder in Windows by default.) EndNote adds .enq as the file name
        extension for saved searches.

  To load a saved search:

     1. On the Search panel, from the Search Options drop-down select Load Search.

     2. In the dialog that appears, select the search strategy that you would like to use, and click Open.

     3. The contents and settings of the Search window change to reflect the saved search. Click Search to
        initiate the search.

  Saved searches are especially useful if you use EndNote's connection files to search online databases.
  When saving search strategies for online databases, it is helpful to include an abbreviation of the online
  database name the search is intended for in the file name. See How to Search an Online Database for
  information on using connection files.

  You can save the search results (the set of matching references) as a group. You can use saved search
  strategies to set up Smart Groups. Smart groups are updated as you add references to your library. Or, you
  can save specific results to Custom Groups. Custom groups are not updated as you add references to your
  library.


Finding Text in a Single Reference
  When you have a reference that contains a significant amount of text, such as long abstracts or notes, it can
  get hard to find things.

  To jump to specific text within a reference, use the Find Text command in the Edit panel.

     1. Select the reference to search in the Reference List.

     2. Select the Edit panel.

     3. Click the Find Text button (the magnifying glass) to open the Find Text dialog.

     4. Enter the search term and press the Enter key.

  EndNote will jump to the first occurrence of the text and highlight it within the reference. You can use the
  Next button (the down arrow) to jump to the next occurrence of the text.


Finding Duplicate References
  In order to help locate duplicate references, EndNote offers a Find Duplicates command. This command
  searches the references that are currently showing in the Library window to identify duplicates. Duplicates
  are determined based on the duplicate criteria specified in preferences. See Duplicates Preferences.


      Page 105 of 631
    Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


To find all of the duplicate references in a library:

   1. With the library open, click on the All References group to show all references.

   2. From the Library menu, select Find Duplicates.

        EndNote will display a Find Duplicates dialog where you can compare duplicates and decide which
        version to keep and which to delete.

        Differences between reference fields are shown with blue highlighting. In addition, EndNote takes
        you to the first reference field in which there is dissimilar content between the two duplicate
        references. Scroll through the list to see which fields contain duplicate content and which contain
        dissimilar content.

   3. For each set of duplicates, you have the option to:

            ▪ Click Keep This Record to save that particular reference and throw the other one in the Trash.

            ▪ Click Skip to leave both references in the library, intact. They will appear in a temporary
               Duplicate References group, so you can review them later.

            ▪ Click Cancel bypasses the side-by-side comparison process. All duplicates will appear in a
               temporary Duplicate References group if you wish to review them.

The older (first entered) reference will always appear in the left column in the Find Duplicates dialog.

 Warning: Before selecting Keep This Record, which will delete the duplicate, check the record numbers
 to be sure that you are not deleting a reference already cited in a paper.

By default, references are considered duplicates if they have the same reference type (such as Journal
Article or Book), and the Author, Year, and Title fields are identical. The criteria for detecting duplicates can
be changed using the Duplicates Preferences settings in EndNote’s Preferences dialog.

References that appear identical may not show up as duplicates if the information in the fields EndNote
checks is slightly different or if the reference types are different. When trying to determine how references
differ, it is helpful to know exactly how EndNote compares them.

Author: Compares last name and first initials (even if the first or middle name are written in full).
Capitalization is not important.

Year: Compared exactly as entered.

Title: Leading articles A, An, or The are ignored, but punctuation is included. Capitalization is not important.

Reference Type: Compared exactly as entered.

When there are no more sets of duplicates to compare, the Find Duplicates dialog closes. The Duplicate
References group is refreshed, the Trash group contains the unwanted duplicate references, and all other
groups are updated appropriately. The Duplicate References group is empty unless at least one set of
duplicates was skipped or the Duplicate References operation was cancelled.

Groups, Group Sets, and Tags
  Groups, group sets, and tags make it easy to break a large library into subsets.

  A group points to a subset of references that already exist in the library, much like a filing system.

  You can further organize your references by storing multiple groups in group sets.

  You can use tags to complement your groups. For example, you could organize your groups by topics and
  then use tags to indicate actions to be taken or reading priority.

  You can have up to 5,000 groups, 5,000 group sets, and 5,000 tags in a library.


Permanent Groups
  Permanent groups are maintained by EndNote and cannot be renamed or deleted. The permanent groups
  are:

      ▪ All References: This displays all of the references in the current library.

      ▪ Unfiled: This group contains those references that are not part of a custom group (and optionally not
         part of a smart group). Right-click on Unfiled to display a context-sensitive menu to toggle the setting
         to Exclude Smart Groups in Unfiled or Include Smart Groups in Unfiled.

      ▪ Trash: This group contains the references you have removed from the library by highlighting
         references and selecting Move References to Trash from the References menu. While the
         references are officially no longer in your library (they will not appear in any other group or reference
         list, they are not included in your reference count, and they cannot be searched or cited), they are
         not completely deleted until you select Delete Trash References from the References menu. Until
         you Delete Trash References, you can still drag references from the Trash group back to your active
         library.


The Groups, Group Sets, and Tags Panel
  The left panel of the Library window displays the groups group sets, and reference tags available in your
  library and is generally referred to as the Groups panel.

  To display a group of references in the Reference List panel, click the group, group set, or tag name.


Types of Groups in EndNote
  There are several types of groups to organize your references in EndNote. The first section of groups are
  automatically generated, and include both permanent groups and temporary groups.


Automatically Generated Groups
  Permanent Groups include the All References, Sync Status, Unfiled, and Trash groups. These are groups
  that will always appear in your library, which you cannot remove or rename.


      Page 107 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      ▪ All References displays every reference in the library.

      ▪ Sync Status is not really a group. The Sync Status button allows you to open the Sync Status dialog
        to review information about the EndNote library that you selected to synchronize with your EndNote
        account.

      ▪ Unfiled displays those references that are not part of a custom group (and, optionally, of a smart
        group).

      ▪ Trash is a holding place for references you have removed from the library but have not yet
        permanently discarded.

  Temporary Groups include the Retractions, Sync Conflicts, Copied References, Duplicate References,
  Imported References, and Recently Added groups. These are groups that will sometimes appear in your
  library, which you cannot remove or rename. These temporary groups may be replaced as you use
  commands in EndNote, and are always deleted when you close a library. (Only the groups are deleted; the
  references remain in the library.)

      ▪ Retractions displays articles in the library which have been retracted. It works with Retraction Watch
        to check for new retractions and provide information on the reason for the retraction.

      ▪ Sync Conflicts contains all of the references for which EndNote has identified a conflict between an
        EndNote reference and an EndNote Web/Online reference.

      ▪ Copied References contains the references last copied to your library using the References > Copy
        References To command.

      ▪ Imported References contains the references last imported using the File > Import command.

      ▪ Recently Added is built into each library (shared, unshared, syncing and unsyncing). This group
        allows users to see the latest references added. The group is handled on a library-by-library basis
        and is not built into global preferences so that it can be set to display the last 24 hours in one library
        and last 30 days in another. Right-Click on this group to set the "recent" time period you prefer to
        see references for: the last 24 hours, 7 days, 14 days, or 30 days.


Manually Created Groups
  Custom groups, smart groups, and combination groups are user defined. You can create up to 5,000 user-
  defined groups and organize them in group sets.

      ▪ Custom Groups are manually created by the user to help organize the library; you can drag-and-
        drop to copy individual references into a custom group. Custom groups are updated only when you
        specifically add or remove references. Custom Groups are listed alphabetically.

      ▪ Smart Groups use search criteria to dynamically update groups as existing references are edited or
        new references are added to the library.

      ▪ Combination Groups allow you to better organize your EndNote references. Combine groups and
        use AND, OR, and NOT to create new, useful smart groups based on other groups. Save references
        in groups and then save sets of groups in group sets. You can collect both custom groups and smart
        groups within the same combination group set.

      ▪ Online Search groups allow you to easily initiate a search of a favorite online database and quickly
        view the latest download.

       ▪ Find Full Text groups are temporary, and appear only when you use the Find Full Text command.

Group Sets
   Group sets are indicated by group set headings in the Groups panel. Some group sets are automatic and
   cannot be removed or renamed. These include Find Full Text, Groups Shared by Others, Online Search,
   and more. A new library begins with one group set you can rename: My Groups. Group sets can contain any
   combination of custom groups and smart groups, as described below.


                Expand a group set by clicking the expand arrow.

                Collapse a group set by clicking the collapse arrow.

   Click and drag a group set heading to move the group set to a new location.

   For more information about group sets, see Group Sets.


Find Full Text
   The Find Full Text group set lists temporary groups that appear when you select Find Full Text from the
   References menu. The groups remain for the current session, but disappear when you close the library.

       ▪ Searching…: This group displays the current set of references for which EndNote is attempting to
          find the full text file of each referenced work. When the full text search is completed, this group is
          deleted. Those references for which the full text was found are displayed in a Found PDF group.

       ▪ Found PDF: This group displays the set of references for which EndNote inserted the PDF file of the
          referenced work as an attachment. These references display a paper clip icon in the File
          Attachments column of the reference list. If a URL is also found, it is added to the reference, but the
          reference is not included in the Found URL group.

       ▪ Found URL: This group displays references that EndNote was unable to download the full text for,
          but for which it found a link that appears to allow access to a copy of the PDF. That link is added to
          the URL field of the reference.

       ▪ Not Found: This group displays the set of references for which EndNote could not identify a full text
          PDF file. These are only from the set of references searched with the Find Full Text command during
          this session of working in the EndNote library.

   For more information about Find Full Text, see Finding Full Text for a Reference and How to Find and
   Retrieve Full Text.


Groups Shared by Others
   Groups that others have shared with you through EndNote online will appear here. See Sharing Groups for
   iniformation on sharing groups, see About Shared Libraries for information on sharing entire libraries.


Online Search
   The Online Search group set in the Groups panel lists your "favorite" connection files for online searching.
   When you click on one of these connection file names, The Advanced Search Panel becomes active and
   you are connected to the selected online service in order to begin searching. You can add or remove


       Page 109 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   connection files from this group using The Connection Manager. For more information about online
   searching, see How to Search an Online Database.


Tags in EndNote
   Tags, like groups, are used to organize an EndNote library. See the Tags section for information on creating
   and using tags in EndNote.


The Groups Panel Search Field
   An EndNote library can have up to 5,000 groups, 5,000 group sets, and 5,000 tags. Use the Search for
   Groups field at the bottom of the Groups Panel to find groups, group sets, or tags within the larger set. The
   Search for Groups field will search for the name of any custom group, smart group, combination group,
   group set, or tag that matches the search term. Search terms need not be whole words; any text string can
   be entered, even if it is text within a longer word.


Custom Groups
   Custom groups are perfect for when you want to build a group of references that are not easily found by
   index term or other common text. You can browse through your reference list and drag individual references
   to a custom group.

   Create group sets in order to organize your custom groups and smart groups. See Group Sets.

   Custom groups and smart groups are listed alphabetically within each group set.


Creating a Custom Group
   You have options for creating a custom group. You can select references and then add them to a new group
   or you can create an empty group and then add references to it.

   A group name can be up to 255 characters in length, but shorter names will show better in the Groups
   panel. There are no restrictions on the characters you can use in a group name. Although it is possible to
   give two different groups the same name, this may cause some confusion if you work in EndNote online
   because no group sets appear online to organize custom groups under.

   You are limited to 5,000 total custom, smart, and combination groups per library. Once you reach that limit,
   you must delete a group before you can add a new one.

Create an Empty Custom Group from the Groups Menu

      1. Select the group set you want to create the new group under. If you do not select a group set, the
         new group will be created under the top level My Groups heading.

      2. Select Create Group from the Groups menu.

      3. Give the new group a name and press Enter.

      4. Add references to the new group. See Adding References to a Custom Group.




       Page 110 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


Create an Empty Custom Group under a Group Set

      1. Right-click on a group set.

      2. Select Create Group from the list.

      3. Give the new group a name and press Enter.

      4. Add references to the new group. See Adding References to a Custom Group.

Create a Custom Group from a Selected Set of References

      1. Select references in the Reference List. If the references are selected from a group set, the new
         group will be added to that group set, if they are selected from All References, the new group will be
         added to the first group set in the library.

      2. From the Groups menu select Add References To > Create Custom Group.

      3. A new custom group with the name New Group will appear.

      4. Right-click on the new group and select Rename Group from the list.

      5. Enter the new name and press Enter.

      6. Drag the new group to the group set you want it in.


Adding References to a Custom Group
   You can add references to a new or existing custom group at any time. You do not have to worry about
   copying the same reference to a group more than once; EndNote will not allow duplicates (based on
   EndNote record numbers, which are unique to each library).

   To add references to a group:

      1. First, select the references you want to add to the group. You can do this in many ways, for example:

          ▪ Click on an individual reference to select it.

          ▪ Display a list of references (such as search results), click in the list of references, and then go to
             the Edit menu and choose Select All.

          ▪ Hold down the Shift key and click on two references to select a range of contiguous references.

          ▪ Hold down the Ctrl key and click on individual references to select them.
      2. Add the selected references to a group. Several methods are available:

          ▪ Drag and drop the selected references onto an existing custom group name in the left panel of
             the Library window.

          ▪ From the Groups menu, select Add References To and then select either the name of an existing
             custom group (or select Create Group to create a new custom group).




       Page 111 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


           ▪ Right-click on the selected reference or selected list of references to display a menu, select Add
              References To, and then select either the name of an existing custom group, or select Create
              Group to create a new custom group.

How to Know Which References Are not Included in Any Custom Groups

   The automatic Unfiled group includes references that do not appear in any custom groups.

   The Unfiled group may or may not include references that are part of a smart group. Right-click on Unfiled to
   display a context sensitive menu and toggle the setting to Exclude Smart Groups in Unfiled or Include Smart
   Groups in Unfiled.


Removing References from a Custom Group
   You can remove references from any of your custom groups. The references will still be in your library and
   appear under All References—they just will not appear in that particular custom group.

   To remove references from a custom group:

      1. In the left Groups panel of the Library window, click on the name of the group.

      2. In the reference list, select the reference(s) you want to remove. You can select multiple references:

           ▪ Hold down the Shift key and click on two references to select a range of contiguous references.

           ▪ Hold down the Ctrl key and click on individual references to select them.
      3. Select the Remove References from Group command in one of these ways:

           ▪ Press the Delete key on your keyboard.

           ▪ From the Groups menu, select Remove References from Group (Ctrl+D).
   Remember that the selected references are only removed from this group. They still exist in All References
   and possibly in other groups.

   If you really want to delete the references from your library, see Deleting References.

    Notes: When you delete a record from a smart group, EndNote also deletes the record from All
    References without warning. To restore the reference, go to Trash and select the reference, then right-
    click to bring up a menu. Select Restore to Library and EndNote returns the reference to the smart group.

    If you delete a reference that is in a custom group, then restore it to the library, the reference's association
    with the custom group will not be restored. You will need to add it to the custom group again.



Smart Groups
   Smart groups are built with search strategies. Smart groups are dynamically updated as you add references
   to and edit references in the library.

   You can create group sets in order to further organize your smart groups and custom groups. See Group
   Sets.



       Page 112 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


Creating a Smart Group
  Smart groups are built with search strategies and are dynamically updated as you add references to and
  edit references in the library.

   Note: You cannot create a smart group when an Online Search group is displayed.

  To create a smart group:

     1. Display the set of references that you would like to search. This would typically be All References.

     2. From the Groups menu, select Create Smart Group… An advanced search dialog appears.

     3. Enter a name for the group, then your search strategy, and then click Create.

  The Smart Group search dialog works the same as the Advanced Search panel. If you need more
  information about how to use the Search dialog, see Searching EndNote References.

  The new smart group will be added to the current group set. If you are searching all references, it will be in
  the top-most group set. You can drag-and-drop the new smart group to any group set.


Creating a Smart Group from an Existing Search Strategy
  You may have already created, and possibly saved, a search strategy to find a subset of references. Rather
  than run the search again each time you enter and edit references, you can use the existing search strategy
  to create a smart group.

  To create a smart group from a search strategy:

     1. Select a group, or select All References to display all references in the library.

     2. Navigate to the Advanced Search panel (see The Advanced Search Panel).

     3. Create your search strategy or, if you have saved a search strategy, select Load Search from the
        Search Options drop-down.

     4. If loading a saved search, locate, select, and open the search strategy to load it into the Advanced
        Search panel.

     5. From the Search Options drop-down, select Convert to Smart Group.

  A smart group named Converted Search is created and stored in the current group set. If you searched all
  references, the Converted Search group will appear in the first group set.You can drag-and-drop the smart
  group to any group set.

  To rename the Converted Group, see Renaming a Group.

  The smart group will be updated with matching references each time you save a reference.



Editing a Smart Group
  You may have created a smart group only to find that you need to tweak the search strategy for the group.


      Page 113 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


  To edit a smart group:

     1. Select the smart group name in the Groups panel.

     2. From the Groups menu, select Edit Group to display the smart group search dialog, or right-click on
        the smart group and select Edit Group from the list. The current search strategy is displayed.

     3. Modify the search strategy as needed, and click Save. (If you need more information about how to
        use the Search dialog, see Searching EndNote References.)

     4. The smart group updates based on the new search strategy.


Combination Groups
  Combine custom and smart groups under a single group to better organize your EndNote references. Use
  AND, OR, and NOT logic to create new, useful combination groups.


Creating a Combination Group
  To create a combination group:

     1. From the Groups panel, select Create from Groups… to display the Create from Groups dialog.

     2. Enter a name for the combination group.

     3. In the fields under the Include References In heading, select up to 10 custom and/or smart groups to
        use as your search criteria.

     4. Use AND, OR, NOT to include or exclude custom and/or smart groups in your combination group.
        (See A Strategy Tip for the AND, OR, and NOT Operators.)

     5. You can also use the Add (+) and Remove (-) buttons to manage which groups you want to include
        in and/or remove from your combination group set.

  You are limited to 5,000 custom, smart, and combination groups per library. Once you reach that limit, you
  must delete a group before you can add a new one.

   Note: You cannot include group sets in a combination group.


Editing a Combination Group
  To edit a combination group:

     1. Select the group that you want to edit.

     2. From the Groups menu, select Edit Group to display the Create from Groups dialog, or right-click on
        the combination group and select Edit Group.

     3. Enter a new name for the group (optional).

     4. Use AND, OR, and NOT to include or exclude custom and/or smart groups in your combined group
        set (optional). (See A Strategy Tip for the AND, OR, and NOT Operators.)


      Page 114 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


     5. You can also use the Add (+) and Remove (-) buttons to manage which groups you want to include
        in and/or remove from your combined group set.

     6. Click Save to save your changes.


Deleting a Combination Group
  To delete a combination group:

     1. Select the group that you want to delete.

     2. From the Groups menu, select Delete Group to display a dialog, or right-click on the
        combination group and select Delete Group.

     3. In the confirmation dialog, select Yes to delete the group or No to cancel and keep the group.


Group Sets
  To help organize your groups, you can create up to 5,000 group sets. Group sets can contain any
  combination of custom groups, smart groups, and combination groups.

  Use the Expand or Collapse icons next to a group set header to expand or collapse the list of groups found
  in that group set.


       Expand a group set by clicking the expand arrow.

       Collapse a group set by clicking the collapse arrow.

  When the list is collapsed, the number next to the group set header reflects the total number of references
  found in each group set. This number could include duplicates (references that are included in more than
  one group).

  Some group sets are automatic and cannot be removed or renamed. These include Online Search and Find
  Full Text.


Creating a Group Set
  A new library begins with a single editable group set titled My Groups. However, you can create up to 5,000
  group sets in your EndNote library.

  To create a group set:

     1. From the Groups menu, select Create Group Set.

     2. Enter a name for the new group set and press Enter.

  When you first create a group set, there are no groups listed below the heading. You can drag groups to
  move them from other group sets to the new group set or you can create new custom groups, smart groups,
  and combination groups under the new group set.

  Selecting a group set shows all the references from the various custom groups, smart groups, and
  combination groups under the set.


      Page 115 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


Moving a Group Set
  To move a group set in the Groups panel, click on the group set heading, hold down the mouse button, and
  drag and drop the group heading to its new position in the Groups panel. The new position will be
  remembered each time you start EndNote.

  You can change the position of any group set, including Online Search and Find Full Text.


Deleting a Group Set
  Are you sure you want to delete that group set? When you delete a group set, all of the groups within that
  group set are also deleted! The references are not deleted; they still reside in your library.

  To delete a group set:

     1. From the Groups menu, select Delete Group Set, or right-click on a group set, then select Delete
        Group Set from the list.

     2. A confirmation dialog will appear. Select Delete if you want to delete the group set and all groups
        within it, or select Cancel if you do not want to delete the group set and the groups within it.

  You cannot delete any of the permanent group sets, such as Online Search or Find Full Text.

  You also cannot delete the last group set left in a library. Each library must have at least one group set as a
  place to store new custom groups, smart groups, or combination groups.


Managing Groups
Renaming a Group
  To rename a group:

     1. Select the group in the Groups panel.

     2. Select the Rename Group command in one of these ways:

         ▪ From the Groups menu, select Rename Group.

         ▪ Right-click on the group name to display a menu, and select Rename Group.
  You cannot rename the automatically created groups: All References, Duplicate References, Imported
  References, Search Results, Unfiled, Trash, Find Full Text, etc..


Renaming a Group Set
  To rename a group set:

     1. Select the group set in the Groups panel.

     2. Select the Rename Group Set command in one of these ways:

         ▪ From the Groups menu, select Rename Group Set.

      Page 116 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


          ▪ Right-click on the group set name to display a menu, and select Rename Group Set.
  Renaming does not affect the groups found in the set. Your groups will remain intact.

  You cannot rename the permanent group sets: Online Search, Groups Shared by Others, or Find Full Text.


Deleting a Group
  When you delete a group, the group is deleted but the references themselves are still part of the library.

  Temporary groups are always removed when you close the library.

  When you delete an Online Search group, it does not mean that you can no longer search that online
  database. You have not deleted the connection file, but you have removed it as a favorite. You can go to
  Tools > Connection Files > Open Connection Manager to add it as a favorite again. To use a connection file
  without making it a favorite, select Tools > Online Search and select the connection file you want from the
  list. (If you do not see the connection file you want in the list, see Installing Additional Connection Files.)

  To delete a group:

     1. Select the group you want to delete.

     2. Select the Delete Group command in one of these ways:

          ▪ From the Groups menu, select Delete Group.

          ▪ Right-click on the group name to display a context-sensitive menu, and select Delete Group.
  In the confirmation dialog, select Yes to delete the group or No to cancel and keep the group.

   Note: If the group you are trying to delete is used in a combination group, you will receive a warning to
   that effect, asking if you still want to delete the group.

  The group is deleted from the library, but the references that were in the group are still part of the library.


Deleting a Group Set
  Are you sure you want to delete that group set? When you delete a group set, all of the groups within that
  group set are also deleted! The references are not deleted; they still reside in your library.

  To delete a group set:

     1. From the Groups menu, select Delete Group Set, or right-click on a group set, then select Delete
        Group Set from the list.

     2. A confirmation dialog will appear. Select Delete if you want to delete the group set and all groups
        within it, or select Cancel if you do not want to delete the group set and the groups within it.

  You cannot delete any of the permanent group sets, such as Online Search or Find Full Text.

  You also cannot delete the last group set left in a library. Each library must have at least one group set as a
  place to store new custom groups, smart groups, or combination groups.

Deleting References from a Group
  When you delete a reference from a group, it is moved to the Trash and is deleted from all groups in your
  library.

  If you want to remove the reference from a custom group without deleting it from your library, see Removing
  References from a Custom Group.

  To delete a reference from your library:

     1. Select the reference(s) to delete in the Reference List.

     2. Select Move References to Trash from the References menu, or drag the selected references to the
        Trash group.

         The references are now moved to the Trash group. The Trash group is a temporary holding place.
         The references are no longer in your library and cannot be cited or searched, but they have not yet
         been irrevocably discarded. If you change your mind, you can still drag a reference from the Trash
         back to the All References group to bring it back into the library, but any associations to custom
         groups it belonged to will be lost. It will need to be added to any custom groups manually.

     3. When you are absolutely certain that you no longer want the reference(s) you have moved to the
        Trash, select the Trash group and then go to the References menu and select Delete Trash
        References.


The Recently Added Group
  The Recently Added group is built into each library (shared, unshared, syncing, and unsyncing) to
  allow users to see the latest references added.

  The Recently Added group displays above the Unfiled gcroup.

  Right-click on the Recently Added group to select the time frame for the references shown.

  The time frame choices are:

      ▪ In the last 24 hours

      ▪ In the last 7 days

      ▪ In the last 14 days

      ▪ In the last 30 days
  The Added to Library time/date stamp is used to determine when the reference was added to the library.

  The group is handled on a library-by-library basis and is not built into global preferences, so it can be set to
  display the last 24 hours in one library and last 30 days in another.


The Lost & Found Group Set
  The Lost & Found group set has special properties. Chances are that you will never see this group set. It
  appears only when some combination of events has caused a group to be separated from the group set it
  belongs to. This is incredibly rare.


      Page 118 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   The Lost & Found group set is a temporary holding place. You cannot add any groups to this set, rename
   them, or search them. The only thing that you can do is drag a group from this set to another group set.
   Once you do that, all functionality returns to the group. Once you have moved all groups from the Lost &
   Found group set, the Lost & Found group set is removed.


Sharing Groups
   EndNote allows you to share an entire EndNote Library with colleagues, but sometimes you might not want
   to share your whole library. Sometimes you just want to share a set of references within your library. For
   this, use the EndNote Shared Groups feature.

   EndNote allows you to share custom groups within your library with up to 1,000 other EndNote desktop or
   EndNote online users per group, and to have others share their custom groups with you. Smart groups and
   combination groups are not available in EndNote online, so they cannot be shared.

   Before you can share groups, you will first need to sync your library to your EndNote account. Only groups
   from your synced library can be shared. See The Sync Feature for more information.

Sharing a Custom Group

   To share a group with a colleague:

      1. Select the custom group in EndNote.

      2. Select Share Group from the Groups menu.

      3. Enter the email address (or addresses, separated by commas) of the people that you would like to
         invite in the email box. You must use the email address they are using for their EndNote account.

      4. For each invitee, use the drop-down box to select the desired access level: Read & Write or Read
         Only. These can be edited later in the Sharing with list, if needed. If access rights are changed later,
         they will receive a notice.

      5. Enter an optional message to be sent to the above email address(es).

      6. Click the Invite button.

      7. The icon by your custom group will change to show that it is now being shared. (This may not show
         until the next time you open EndNote.)

   Your colleague will receive an email telling them a group has been shared with them. When they next open
   their synced EndNote library, they will see your group listed under the Groups Shared by Others group set.
   Clicking on this group will send them to their EndNote online library, where they can find the group listed
   under their online Groups Shared by Others heading. They can access the references online and use them
   in their word-processing documents using Cite While You Write's EndNote Online option.

   Colleagues do not need to be using EndNote on the desktop to share a group with them. Groups can also
   be shared with colleagues using the free version of EndNote online.

    Note: Attachments are not shared when sharing a group.

      1. Select the custom group in EndNote.

      2. Select Share Group from the Groups menu.

      3. Click the Settings (the Gear icon) button to the right of a person's name.

      4. Select from the following options:

          ▪ Remove: This will remove them from your shared group. They will no longer have access to your
             references.

          ▪ Remind: This will allow you to remind people they have access to your shared group.

          ▪ Read Only: If their current permission level is Read & Write, this will change it to Read Only.

          ▪ Read & Write: If their current permission level is Read Only, this will change it to Read & Write.
      5. Make your changes and click the Close button.


Important Points about Groups
   Keep these points in mind as you work with groups:

       ▪ You can create up to 5,000 custom groups, smart groups, and combination groups (5,000 combined)
          in a single library.

       ▪ You can create a maximum of 5,000 group sets in a single library.

       ▪ You can add a reference to a particular group only once (based on the unique record number). A
          single reference will never appear more than once in a particular group. However, you can add that
          reference to any number of groups.

       ▪ When you are viewing a group of references with selected references, and then switch to viewing All
          References, the references are selected in the All References group until you deselect them.

       ▪ You can drag references from one library directly into a custom group in another open library. The
          references are copied to the second library and into the target custom group.

       ▪ Deleting a reference from any group deletes it from the library. If you want to remove a
          reference from a custom group, but not delete it from the library, see Removing References from a
          Custom Group. (You cannot remove a reference from a smart group because the contents of the
          group are based on search results.)

       ▪ Once you move a reference to the Trash group, it is no longer officially in your library (it will not
          appear in any other group or reference list, it is not included in your reference count, and it cannot be
          searched or cited). However, until you select Delete Trash References from the References menu, or
          Right-Click on the Trash and select Empty Trash, you can still drag the reference from the Trash
          group back to your active library.

Tags
   Like groups and group sets, reference tags (usually just called "tags") are a way of organizing an EndNote
   library but are distinct from the groups features, even though they are listed in the Groups panel.

   For example, you may wish to organize your groups and group sets by topic but prefer to organize your tags
   by action (such as reading priority for a paper), purpose (such as for a project), or class (such as required
   reading for a class). These are just examples of how tags can be used. The organization system you build
   with groups, group sets, and tags is totally up to you.

   Think of it this way. You assign references to a group or group set, or EndNote assigns them to a smart or
   combined group based on search criteria. So references within the group structure are like references within
   a filing structure, with headings and subheadings, with the freedom to "file" the same reference under
   multiple headings. Tags are more like sticky notes that can be stuck on top of a document on your desk to
   attract your attention to that document―in EndNote drawing your attention to specific references with a
   small colored "tag" ( ) in the reference list. So, when you tag a reference, you are marking it to make it
   visible and easy to find, but you are not "filing" it in a hierarchical structure as with groups and group sets.
   This makes tags ideal for assigning priorities, actions to be taken regarding the reference, or anything else
   you want to make visible in the reference list that falls outside of the "filing system" of groups. Tags add a
   new flexibility to organization in EndNote.

   An EndNote library can contain up to 5,000 tags, which can be assigned up to seven colors. The My Tags
   group can be expanded to show a list of tags or collapsed to hide the list using the buttons shown below.


             Expand the My Tags group by clicking the expand arrow.

             Collapse the My Tags group by clicking the collapse arrow.

   When a reference has been tagged in EndNote, a small, colored tag mark ( ) will appear at the end of the
   title in the reference list. If multiple tags are assigned to the same reference, the tag mark ( ) will show
   multiple colors.

   Tags will be Synced when the library is Synced and will appear in EndNote on the desktop and EndNote
   Web.



Creating Tags
   Reference tags can be created several ways in EndNote.

Creating Tags from the Tags Menu

   To create a reference tag from the Tags menu:

       1. Select Create Tag… from the Tags menu.

       2. Give the new tag a name.

       3. Choose a color for the tag.

       4. Click the Create Tag button.

   The new tag will be added to your list of tags.

Creating Tags from the My Tags Group

   To create a tag from the My Tags group:

       1. Click the Plus button (+) by the My Tags group.




       2. Give the new tag a name.

       3. Choose a color for the tag.

       4. Click the Create Tag button.

   The new tag will be added to your list of tags.

Creating Tags from the Reference Panel

   To create a tag from the Summary or Edit panels in the Reference panel:

       1. Click the Manage Tags button in the Summary or Edit panel.

       2. Click the Create tag button.

       3. Give the tag a name.

       4. Choose a color for the tag.

       5. Click the Create Tag button.

   The new tag will be added to your list of tags and assigned to the reference. Click OK to close the Manage
   tags window.



Assigning and Removing Tags

Assigning Tags to References

Assigning a Tag to Multiple References

   Drag a set of references to the reference tag under My Tags in the Groups panel.

    Note: This is the only method for assigning a tag to multiple references.


Assigning a Tag to a Single Reference

   Tags can be assigned to a single reference using any of the methods below.

       1. Drag a reference to the tag under My Tags in the Groups panel

       2. Right-click on a single reference in the reference list to view the contextual menu.



       Page 122 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


          a. Select Manage Tags from the contextual menu.

          b. Select the tag or tags you want to assign to the reference.

          c. Click the OK button.

      3. In the Summary or Edit panel of the Reference panel, click the Manage tags button.

          a. Select the tag or tags you want to assign to the reference.

          b. Click the OK button.

Removing Tags from References

   Tags can only be removed from references individually. Here are three ways to remove a tag from a
   reference.

      1. Select a single reference in the reference list.

          a. Select the Summary panel in the Reference panel.

          b. Scroll down, if necessary, to view the Tags section of the summary and click the X by the tag
             you want to unassign from the reference.




      2. Right-click on a single reference in the reference list to view the contextual menu.

          a. Select Manage Tags from the contextual menu.

          b. Click the X to the right of the tag or tags you want to unassign from the reference.




          c. Click the OK button.



      Page 123 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       3. In the Summary or Edit panel of the Reference panel, click the Manage tags button.

            a. Click the X to the right of the tag or tags you want to remove from the reference as shown
               above.

            b. Click the OK button.

    Note: Removing a tag from a reference is permanent. The Edit > Undo command will not restore a
    removed tag to a reference. If you accidentally remove a tag from a reference, you will need to reassign
    the tag to the reference.


    Note: To delete a tag completely, which will also remove the tag from all references to which it was
    assigned, see Editing and Deleting Tags. Deleting tags is permanent. The Edit > Undo command will not
    restore a deleted tag.



Editing and Deleting Tags
   Tags added to the My Tags list in the Groups panel can be renamed, edited to change the color of the
   reference tag, or deleted. Changes made to a tag will apply to all references that tag is assigned to.

   If you want to assign tags to a reference or remove them from a reference, see Assigning and Removing
   Tags.

Renaming a Tag

   To rename a tag:

       1. Select the tag to rename from the My Tags list.

       2. Select Rename Tag from the Tags menu.

       3. Type in the new name.

       4. Press the Enter key.

Editing a Tag

   To edit a tag:

       1. Select the tag to edit from the My Tags list.

       2. Select Edit Tag… from the Tags menu.

       3. Type in a new name to change the name of the tag.

       4. Choose a different color to change the color of the tag.

       5. Click the Update Tag button.

Deleting a Tag

   To delete a tag—

       1. Select the tag to delete from the My Tags list. A confirmation window similar to the one below will be
          presented. It shows the number of references the tag is assigned to. If the tag is deleted, the tag will
          be removed from all of these references.




       2. Click Delete if you want to delete the tag, or Cancel if you do not want to delete the tag.

    Note: The window above also shows an option labeled "Do not show this message again." This message
    is a safety feature. Deleted tags are permanently deleted; you will not be able to restore them using the
    Undo command (Ctrl-Z). If you mark this option, in the future all tags will be immediately deleted if you
    select them and then select Delete from the Tags menu, and you will not be able to undo the change.



Important Points about Tags
   Keep these points in mind as you work with reference tags:

       ▪ You can create up to 5,000 tags in a single library.

       ▪ The Search for Groups field at the bottom of the Groups panel will search for tags as well as groups.

       ▪ You can assign a tag to a particular reference only once. However, that tag can be assigned to any
          number of references.

       ▪ When you select a set of references with the same tag under the My Tags group, and then switch to
          viewing All References, the references are selected in the All References group until you deselect
          them.

       ▪ You can drag tagged references from one library directly into another open library. The references
          are copied to the second library but will not include the assigned tag unless the same tag is defined
          under My Tags in the second library.

       ▪ Deleting a tagged reference selected under any tag in the My Tags group deletes it from the library. If
          you want to remove a tag from a reference see Assigning and Removing Tags.

       ▪ Once you move a reference to the Trash group, it is no longer officially in your library. However, until
          you select Delete Trash References from the References menu, or Right-Click on the Trash and




       Page 125 of 631

  select Empty Trash, you can still drag the reference from the Trash group back to your active library
  and it will retain any assigned tags.

Searching Online Databases
  EndNote’s search interface provides a simple way to do basic searches of EndNote libraries and online
  databases. The same Advanced Search panel is used for both purposes.

  This search interface is not intended to replace the advanced search options that may be available using the
  search interface offered by your information provider. There may be times when you want to use the
  information provider’s search interface (for example, to take advantage of a thesaurus of search terms) and
  then import those references into EndNote. This is still an option using EndNote’s Import command (see
  Importing Reference Data into EndNote). But once you know the terms that you want to use in your
  searches, being able to retrieve the necessary references directly from EndNote is a very fast and efficient
  approach.


How Does It Work?
  EndNote is able to provide access to these remote sources using an information retrieval protocol called
  Z39.50, which is widely supported by libraries and information providers around the world. It provides a
  convenient method to access their library catalogs and reference databases.

  EndNote stores the information necessary to connect to and search these online databases in individual
  connection files. Preconfigured connection files are provided for a number of these sources. If necessary,
  you can also customize or configure your own connections to Z39.50-compliant databases (see Editing a
  Connection File and Creating Connection Files).

   Note: If the online database that you access is not available on a Z39.50 server, EndNote will not be able
   to connect directly to it. You can still import references downloaded from non-Z39.50 databases. See
   Importing Reference Data into EndNote.



How to Search an Online Database
  The process of searching an online database is very similar to searching an EndNote library. Here are the
  basic steps involved; more detailed descriptions of these steps are provided in additional help topics.

  To search and retrieve references from a online database:

     1. Initiate the online search in one of these two ways:

         ▪ From the Tools menu, select Online Search to display the collection of connection files installed
            on your computer.

            or

            Click more under the Online Search group set. Select the online database that you would like to
            search, and then click Choose. See Selecting a Connection File.

            When the connection has been established, the Search panel appears ready for you to enter a
            search.

         ▪ Once you have searched an online database, or marked the database as a favorite with the
            Connection Manager, it appears in the Online Search group set in the Groups panel.

      Page 127 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


     2. Enter your search request in the search fields on the Advanced Search panel, and then click Search.
        EndNote searches the database and displays the number of references that were found to match
        your search criteria.

     3. Click OK to retrieve the references.

         If you would like to pause during record retrieval, click Pause. When you are ready to continue, click
         Resume.

   Note: The connection to the online database is maintained only until the search is completed and the
   matching references are retrieved; when the references are downloaded, you are automatically
   disconnected. Each time you initiate another search, EndNote reconnects.


Next, Determine Which References to Keep
  The retrieved references are stored in the Online Search group set for the library, but they are not yet in your
  EndNote library.

     1. Select the references you want to add to your library.

     2. Now you have choices on how to add the references to your library.

          ▪ Go to the References menu and select Copy References To in order to select a new or existing
             library and copy the selected references to that selected library.

          ▪ Right-click on the selected references and select Copy References To from the list in order to
             select a new or existing library and copy the selected references to that selected library.

          ▪ Drag and drop the references into the group you want to add them to in the library.

          ▪ Mark the references using the checkmark boxes to the left of them, and then click the Add the
             selected records to your local library button to add them to your library.



  If you used the Copy References To command, the references are copied to the selected library and are
  displayed in a Copied References group. Each time you copy references into an EndNote library, the Copied
  References group is replaced with the new set of references. Previously copied references remain in the
  library; they are just no longer part of the latest Copied References group.


Searching an Online Database
Online Database Searching (Overview)
  Searching an online database is essentially the same as searching your own EndNote library. After
  establishing a connection:

     1. Enter your search term(s) in the fields on the Advanced Search panel.

     2. Select the appropriate search options.

     3. Click Search to send the search request to the online database.



      Page 128 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


  A few significant differences between searching an online database and an EndNote library are described in
  Searching EndNote Fields vs. Online Database Indexes. See The Advanced Search Panel for general
  information about using the Advanced Search panel interface.


Establishing the Connection
  The first step to searching an online database is to connect to it. Once the connection has been made,
  you’re able to use EndNote’s Advanced Search panel to search the online database.

  If you have connected to a particular database before or if you have selected a database as one of your
  favorites (see Adding Favorite Connection Files), it will appear in the Groups panel under Online Search.
  This saves you a few steps in the process of using the Online Search command.

  To connect to an online database, do one of these:

      ▪ On the Groups panel, under Online Search, select the online database you want to search. That
         initiates the online connection.

      ▪ If the database you want to search is not listed under Online Search in the Groups panel, select
         Tools > Online Search, select the desired database, and click Choose to initiate the connection.

         or

         Click the more… button in the Online Search group set, select the desired database, and click
         Choose to initiate the connection.

  This Connection dialog is very similar to the Connection Manager described in The Connection Manager,
  but it does not provide the options to edit connection files or mark them as favorites. However, it does
  contain a Quick Search field that the Connection Manager does not. Here you can enter the name, or a
  portion of the name, of the file your are looking for, then press Enter to find files matching the text entered.

  When a successful connection has been made, the Search panel opens with the online database selected
  for searching. You are now ready to begin searching the database.

  The connection to the online database is maintained only until the search is completed and the matching
  references are retrieved; when the references are downloaded, you are automatically disconnected. Each
  time you initiate another search, EndNote reconnects.

   Note: If you have difficulty establishing a connection, see Troubleshooting Connections.


Available Search Options
  Once you are connected to an online database and that database is selected for searching, certain
  elements on the Search panel change from the settings that are available for EndNote library searches.

      ▪ The search set list changes when searching an online source. You can search either the remote
         database or the list of references already retrieved and saved from the remote source.

      ▪ The options available in the search menus (such as Author, Title, or Keywords) vary with each
         database, and they are not the same as searching the fields in an EndNote library (see Searching
         EndNote Fields vs. Online Database Indexes).

      ▪ The following fields are not available in the search menu for searching an online source: PDF, Any
         Field + PDF with Notes, and PDF Notes.

      Page 129 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      ▪ The comparison list for each search line is always set to Contains.

Boolean Searches
  Multiple search terms can be combined using the Boolean operators AND, OR, and NOT. EndNote
  constructs a search from the top to the bottom of the Search panel, finding the search results of the first two
  items, then combining that result set with the third search line, and so on.

                       Comparison Search           Boolean
       Field
                       Operator   Term             Operator

       Keywords        Contains      parrot        AND

       Keywords        Contains      corvid        NOT

       Keywords        Contains      avian         OR

       Keywords        Contains      Emery

                       Boolean Operators Table

  For example, the search shown above could be written as:

  (((parrot AND corvid) NOT avian) OR Emery)

  First EndNote looks for references about parrots and corvids, then any references to avian would be omitted
  from that set, and finally all references by Emery would be added.

  Keep in mind that:

      ▪ OR broadens your search by adding together two result sets

      ▪ AND narrows the focus of the search by looking for the intersection of references found

      ▪ NOT narrows the search by omitting the results for one term from the current result set.
  See A Strategy Tip for the AND, OR, and NOT Operators for an example search strategy to help with using
  these three operators.


Searching EndNote Fields vs. Online Database Indexes
  When searching an online database, you are not searching the specific fields in each record, but rather the
  available search indexes for that database. The search menus on the Search panel list only available
  indexes for the online database, so you will not see all of the generic field names listed as you do when
  searching an EndNote library.

  If the current search strategy is set up to search an EndNote field that does not exist as an online database
  search index, that field name will appear in italics. If you try to execute a search, EndNote will advise you
  that the field is not valid. Change the search field selection to a valid index for the selected online database.

  The connection file for a particular database stores the names and settings for the search options listed in
  the search menus. See Search Attributes in Connection Files if you are interested in changing the
  preconfigured options.




      Page 130 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


    Note: Comparison operators other than "Contains" cannot be used when searching online databases.


Understanding Search Results

   When searching an online database, the search menus display a list of available search indexes supported
   at the remote site. These are not fields in the online database, but rather sets of search terms and
   synonyms designed to facilitate your searches.

   It is not uncommon to search for a term in an index and notice that the exact term appears nowhere in the
   retrieved reference(s). For example, you might search for heart attack in the Title index of a medical
   database and find references that do not include heart attack in the Title field but, instead, they use the term
   myocardial infarction. This apparent discrepancy can be attributed to the search index of the online
   database, which has mapped the common term heart attack to its scientific equivalent myocardial infarction.

   It is also not uncommon for some of these databases to index personal names that appear in the titles or
   keywords along with the author names. For example, a search of the Library of Congress for "Charles
   Dickens" in the Author index displays books about Dickens as well as those written by him. This form of
   indexing is most commonly seen with library book catalogs and not with the scientific reference databases.
   Sometimes you can restrict the searches to books by that particular author by setting up a search to find (for
   example) "Charles Dickens" in Author, NOT "Charles Dickens" in Keywords.

   These search indexes are maintained by the providers of the databases and are not controlled by EndNote.


Online Database Search Limitations
   Some of the search options have additional limitations that you would not encounter when searching an
   EndNote library. For example, some databases prohibit searching for a year alone. The year can be
   specified only to limit a search (these are called "limit fields"). In such a case, a search for 1997 as the year
   would be denied, but searching for Smith as an author AND 1997 as the year (thereby limiting the results of
   the author search), would be allowed.

   If you have set up a search that is not accepted by the online database, an error message will describe the
   source of the problem as specifically as possible. (See Troubleshooting Connections.) Keep in mind that
   these restrictions are set by the information provider, not EndNote.

   Documentation from the information provider may help to clarify which search options are available.


Changing the Focus of the Search
   The target of the search is the online database (represented by the database name on the Search panel) or
   the current EndNote library group that is displayed when the Search command is chosen. (If you haven’t yet
   connected to the online database or opened a library, you will need to do so before you can search it.) To
   change the focus of a search, click on a different library group or online database in the Groups panel.

   The available search options differ among the various online databases, as well as between online
   databases and EndNote libraries. When you change the target of a search, the field options on the Search
   panel change automatically. You could set up a Keywords search for a particular online database, but when
   you select a different online database, the field selection changes because Keywords is not an option for the
   new database selection.

   When switching the focus of your search from one group to another and back again, the original search
   setup is retained as long as you have not changed any settings on the Search panel and the field selections
   are available in both databases.

      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide



Selecting a Connection File
  Before an online source may be searched, you must first connect to it by selecting the corresponding
  connection file. The connection file tells EndNote which online database you want to search, where to find it
  online, and what search options are available for it.


Access-Restricted Databases
  EndNote comes with preconfigured connection files to free reference databases and library catalogs as well
  as databases that require payment and/or authentication for access. Most of the databases offered by the
  commercial information providers (Ovid, OCLC, etc.) require an account for access. There are, however,
  numerous databases that are available at no cost to you, and no account is required (see Free Databases).

  When you attempt to connect to a restricted database, by default EndNote prompts you to enter your user
  ID and/or password. If you have a user ID and/or password supplied by the data provider that hosts the
  restricted database, enter the necessary information, and click OK to log on. (Depending on the database
  you are accessing, the passwords and IDs may be case-sensitive.)

   Note: The User ID and password must be the one provided by the database provider. Student, Faculty, or
   employee logons for your system are unlikely to work because they are provided by your institution, not
   the database provider. You may be able to access the database through IP address recognition instead. If
   you find you are unable to access the database through Online Search, you can still search the database
   through a Web browser and then import your references into EndNote. See Importing Reference Data
   into EndNote for more information. Clarivate does not control access to databases from other database
   providers.

  If you do not have a user ID and/or password, but instead have authenticated access to a database either
  by IP address recognition (for example, your computer is on your university campus or company network
  and has an IP address that is recognized as authenticated by the data provider’s server) or through a proxy
  server, it may be possible to configure the connection file and your Network Preferences so that you do not
  need to enter a user ID and password.

  If you have access to a restricted database by IP address recognition, you may need to edit the connection
  file so that it does not prompt you for a user ID and/or password. In EndNote, select Tools > Connection
  Files > Open Connection Manager. Locate the connection file for the database you wish to access, select it,
  and click Edit. Click Connection Settings and clear the User ID and Password boxes under Login
  Information Required. Close the connection file, choosing Yes when asked if you want to save your
  changes.

   Note: To access databases using IP authentication, you must be on the authenticated network. If you are
   off-site, this is usually managed through an institutional VPN. Contact your institution's library or technical
   support group for information on institutional VPN setup.

  If you have access to a restricted database via a proxy server, you must make sure that your Internet
  settings are properly configured, because EndNote uses these settings. Note that these are operating
  system settings, not browser settings. See Problems Connecting for information about proxy servers. You
  will need the address and port number of your proxy server.

Adding Favorite Connection Files
   EndNote provides thousands of connection files for a variety of sources. Whenever you use a connection
   file you have not used in the past, it is automatically added to your list of favorite connection files and will
   show in the Online Search group set.

   You can also add multiple connection files to favorites using the Connection Manager.

      1. To peruse the list of installed connection files, choose Tools > Connection Files > Open Connection
         Manager. The list includes the original connection files installed in the EndNote program folder (\
         \EndNote 2025\Connections), as well as any user created or edited files stored in your personal
         Connections folder (see Folder Locations Preferences).

      2. When you have found a connection file that you will want to use in the future, click the checkbox to
         the left of it to mark it as a favorite. Marked files (up to 500) appear under the Online Search group
         set in the Groups panel, giving you easy access to those files you use most often.

    Note: By default, EndNote only installs a list of popular connection files, but you can customize the
    installation to install more connection files. See Custom Installations/Adding Content Files for more
    information.

   If you have installed a large number of connection files, use the following features in the Connection
   Manager window to locate the connection file(s) that you want to use:

       ▪ Click in the list and start typing the name of a connection file. Use the letter "u" as an abbreviation for
          "university." Other words might also be abbreviated. For example, the University of California at San
          Francisco would be searched for as "U Calif-San Francisco." EndNote will jump to the first letter that
          matches very quickly, so you may only be able to type a few letters, to help you get near the file you
          want.

       ▪ Click Find by and EndNote displays the list of information providers (categories) used for all of the
          connection files. Choose one to restrict the list to show just that set of files.


       Page 133 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       ▪ Click the column headings to sort the connection files by name or by information provider. Clicking
          the same column heading a second time will change the sort order from ascending to descending.
          Click again to set it back to ascending order.

   Click the More Info button at the bottom of the dialog to display additional information about the selected
   connection file.

    Note: For information about editing connection files or creating new ones, see Introduction to Connection
    Files.


What if Your Database Is Not Listed?
   By default, EndNote installs only the most popular connection files. For information about locating and
   installing additional files, see Installing Additional Connection Files.

   If a connection file has not been provided for the database that you want to search, contact your librarian or
   information provider to see if their database is available on a Z39.50 server. If it is, you should request the
   information required to set up a Z39.50 client for that database. See Creating Connection Files.


Adding Connection Files
   The Connection Manager displays all of the connection files in the EndNote program folder as well as in
   your personal Connections folder. If you have received a connection file from a colleague or librarian or
   downloaded one from the Web, copy it into your personal Connections folder and it will appear in the
   Connection Manager. Keeping the file in your personal Connections folder ensures that it will not be deleted
   or overwritten with future updates to the EndNote program.

   To locate your personal Connections folder or to designate a different Connections folder:

      1. Select Preferences from the Edit menu.

      2. Select the Folder Locations option.

      3. Select the Connections Folder option.

      4. Click Select Folder if you want to select a different folder to use for your personal Connections folder.
         The default folder should be in your Documents folder.

      5. Use your personal Connections folder to store and access connection files you have created or
         modified. They will show up in Connection Manager or when you click the more button in the Online
         Search group set.

    Note: New and updated connection files are posted on the EndNote Web site as they become available
    (Download EndNote Connection Files).



Retrieving and Saving References
   After a successful search, EndNote alerts you to the number of references that were found in The
   Connection Status Panel. You have the option of retrieving all of the references or a specific range of
   references. The order of the retrieved references reflects the way they were returned from the server—this
   is not necessarily alphabetical, chronological, or in order of relevance.)


       Page 134 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


  Retrieved references are downloaded into the group selected in the Online Search group set, but are not
  automatically saved to a library. To save references, select them, and then:

      ▪ Go to the References menu and select Copy References To in order to select a new or existing
         library and copy the selected references to that library.

      ▪ Click the Add the selected online records to your local library (+) button at the right side of The
         Connection Status Panel.

      ▪ Drag and drop the selected references to a group in the current library.

      ▪ Use the Copy and Paste commands from the Edit menu to copy individual references from the
         Online Search group and then paste them into a library group.


Discarding Duplicate References
  If you use the same search strategy to search multiple online sources, you may introduce duplicate
  references into your EndNote library. See Finding Duplicate References for information on removing
  duplicates from the library.


The Connection Status Panel
  The Connection Status panel provides abbreviated information on the results of an online search. You can
  select the number of results to download, or quickly add references to your library using the Add the
  selected online records to your local library button (+) at the right.




    Connection Status Panel

  For more detailed information on the status of connections during your current EndNote session, see The
  Connection Status Window and The Connect Log File. This log file can be helpful for troubleshooting
  connection files.


The Connection Status Window
  The Connection Status window provides detailed information about a connection and EndNote’s interactions
  with the online database and server. This window is useful to help you or to help EndNote Technical Support
  assist you in tracking down the source of a problem with an online database.

  View the connection status information by selecting Show Connection Status from the Tools menu to display
  the Status window.

  The Status window displays information for the latest connection. A menu at the top of the Status window
  lets you view either the record data for each reference or the status messages returned from the server of
  the online database.

   Note: The Connection Status window displays the last 32K of text written to the The Connect Log File. If
   you need to see more than that, you can open the Connection.log file in a word processor after closing
   the EndNote connection.


      Page 135 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


The Connect Log File
   All messages and retrieved references for a given EndNote session are recorded in a log file. By default, the
   log file is called "Connect.log" and is saved in the folder:

       C:\Users\[UserName]\App Data\Roaming\EndNote\

   An existing log file is overwritten the first time EndNote establishes a connection after being started.

   You may select a different name and/or location for the log file using the URLs & Links settings in the
   Preferences window. To do so, select Preferences from the Edit menu and select the URLs & Links option
   from the list. Click Choose in the Connection Log section to name the new log file and choose where to save
   it.

   You may also choose not to create a log file by clearing the Use Log File option. This will slightly speed up
   the retrieval process. However, a log file can be useful for troubleshooting connection problems or when
   building or editing a custom connection file.

Importing a Log File

   The log file is a regular text file. It can be viewed using a word processor and imported, if necessary, using
   the connection file. In this sense, the log file is a back up for the references retrieved in a particular EndNote
   session. You can verify that EndNote retrieved the reference data correctly by browsing through the log file
   in your word processor and comparing the unmodified data to what appears in your EndNote references. If
   necessary, you can change the settings in your connection file and import the references again (without
   reconnecting to the online database).

    Note: You cannot import from a Connect.log file saved for a search from the Web of Science Core
    Collection. You must do a regular online search or a direct export.

   To import a log file using the filter options of a connection file:

      1. Open a library into which you want to import the log file.

      2. From the File menu, select Import > File.

      3. Click Choose…, navigate to the folder for the Connect.log file and select it. Substitute the name of
         your log file if you have changed the default name.

      4. Select Use Connection File from the Import Option list in the Import File dialog

      5. Select the desired connection file, and then click Choose. Now you should be back in the Import File
         dialog with both the file and the import option set.

      6. Next to Text Translation, select No Translation.

      7. Click Import.

    Note: The connection file and filter file for a database are likely configured to import very different
    reference formats. Normally, a connection file is set up for MARC (Machine Readable Cataloging) data,
    whereas a filter is set up for tagged data. Because the output formats are so different, you should not use
    a filter file.

Users of Previous Versions of EndNote
  If you used a previous version of EndNote, many of your preferences were saved when you upgraded to
  EndNote. However, if you want the ability to link back to Web of Science Core Collection records and
  product databases, you may need to update the Base URL.

     1. From the Edit menu, select Preferences.

     2. Click the EndNote Defaults button to update to the latest Base URL.


Searching Author Names in Web of Science Databases that Contain
Particles and Spaces
  When searching a Web of Science product database (for example, the CABI or MEDLINE), you may need to
  add a connector to names that contains particles and spaces. For example, to search for de Bruyn A, enter
  the name in the Search field as de+Bruyn+A to ensure that the product returns all relevant results.

  To search for de la Rosa, enter the name in the Search field as la+Rosa. You can also add a first name to
  restrict your search, but do not add a connector between the first name and the last name. For example, to
  search for Mario de la Rosa, enter in the Search field Mario de+la+Rosa.

Finding Full Text for a Reference
  EndNote can attempt to locate full text files on the Web by using data stored in your references. If found,
  EndNote downloads and attaches the files to the references.

  EndNote uses these resources when searching for full text publications:

      ▪   PubMed

      ▪   Clarivate Links

      ▪   DOI

      ▪   OpenURL

  EndNote will try to use all of these methods to optimize the likelihood of finding full text files associated with
  your bibliographic records.

  The Web of Science Core Collection free journal set is checked for all users; subscribers may have
  increased IP-based access to all resources. In cases where full text PDF files require a subscription, and
  you or your institution have the appropriate access, EndNote will attempt to authenticate and automatically
  download the appropriate files. If EndNote cannot find the full text file, it will often be able to attach the URL
  of the provider's Web page for the article for easier future access.


How to Find and Retrieve Full Text
  When you retrieve the full text file of a referenced work, it is saved to the File Attachments field as a relative
  link (the file itself it stored in the current library’s .Data folder). The file is saved in its native format, which in
  most cases is a PDF file.

  When a file is downloaded and attached to a reference, a file attachment icon appears in the File
  Attachment field for the reference. In the Reference List, a paper clip icon appears in the File Attachments
  column for that reference.

  The Find Full Text command can attempt to find full text documents for up to 250 records at a time; this total
  includes all full text searches run concurrently in open databases. If you want to find the full text for more
  than 250 EndNote records, you must run the Find Full Text operation more than once. Select up to 250
  references each time.

   Note: References must be in an EndNote library to use Find Full Text. You cannot find the full text for
   references in Online Search groups. Copy your references to your library, then run Find Full Text.

  To find and retrieve full text:

     1. Select the reference(s) to which you want to add full text.

            ▪ In the Library window, highlight up to 250 references.
                For example, you can select a single reference, or hold down the Ctrl key to select individual
                references, or use Edit > Select All to select an entire set of displayed references.



      Page 139 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


     2. From the References menu, select Find Full Text > Find Full Text. You can also right-click a
        reference in the Reference List and select Find Full Text from the contextual menu or use the Search
        the Web for full text documents for the select references button on the toolbar.




     3. (Optional) If you have entered an OpenURL address and authentication URL in the Find Full Text
        Preferences, you may be directed to a login web page for your institution’s library. Follow the
        instructions to log in, such as entering the appropriate User ID and password. Once you are logged
        in, click Continue.

  EndNote begins searching for and downloading full text for the selected references. Full text downloading
  happens in the background, which may affect the performance of other operations.

  References appear in groups under a Find Full Text group set. See Find Full Text Groups for a description of
  the resulting groups.

   Note: Your institution may sever your OpenURL connection after a certain amount of time. Unfortunately,
   there is no indication when that happens. You will need to go to the References menu, select Find Full
   Text, and then Authenticate to restore access to the site. Just selecting Find Full Text again during this
   EndNote session will not restore authentication.

  To add access to a library, see Adding Access to Your Institution's Library.

  To improve the likelihood of finding full text articles for references, see Improving the Search for Full Text.

  If you want to pause or cancel a Find Full Text operation, see Pausing or Canceling Find Full Text.

   Note: Some institutions or data providers may have restrictions on downloading large numbers of PDFs
   using methods such as Find Full Text. If you are unsure of the restrictions for your institution, check with
   your library.



Find Full Text Groups
  During the Find Full Text searching and downloading process, results are constantly updated under a Find
  Full Text group set.

  The results of a Find Full Text search remain for the current session until you close the library. The
  categories include:

      ▪ Searching…

      ▪ Found PDF

      ▪ Found URL

      ▪ Not found
  If you run the Find Full Text operation more than once during a single library session, the additional
  references are added to the references already found in the Find Full Text groups.




      Page 140 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


Searching...
   This group displays the current set of references for which EndNote is attempting to find either the full text
   file of each referenced work or at least a URL to the referenced work. When the full text search is
   completed, this group is deleted. Those references to which full text or a URL was added are displayed in a
   Found PDF group or a Found URL group.

   You can cancel the Find Full Text operation at any time by right-clicking on the Searching group, to display a
   context-sensitive menu, and selecting Cancel finding full text. Full text that has been retrieved until that point
   is already saved in the library.

   You can pause the Find Full Text operation at any time by right-clicking on the Searching group, to display a
   context-sensitive menu, and selecting Pause finding full text. Full text that has been retrieved until that point
   is already saved in the library.


Found PDF
   This group displays the set of references for which EndNote inserted the PDF file of the referenced work as
   an attachment. These references display a paper clip icon in the File Attachments column of the Reference
   List. If a URL is also found, it is added to the reference, but the reference is not included in the Found URL
   group.

   If the Find Full Text operation recognizes an already attached file as being the same as that found for a
   selected reference, EndNote will not attach the new file. This means the original PDF, with any personal
   annotations, will not be replaced by the newly found PDF. If it finds a different file, it will add the new file to
   the record. For example, if you manually added a PDF of related material, but not the article itself, when the
   PDF for the article is found, it will be attached to the PDF by Find Full Text.


Found URL
   This group displays the set of references for which EndNote inserted a URL to the referenced work, but did
   not find a full text document to attach.


Not Found
   This group displays the set of references for which EndNote could not identify a full text file or a URL. These
   are only from the set of references searched with the Find Full Text command during this session of the
   EndNote library.


Pausing or Canceling Find Full Text
       ▪ To pause a Find Full Text operation, right-click on the Searching… group to display a context-
          sensitive menu, and select Pause finding full text. Full text that has been retrieved until that point is
          already saved in the library.

       ▪ To resume a paused Find Full Text operation, right-click on the Searching group and select Resume
          finding full text.

       ▪ To stop a Find Full Text operation, right-click on the Searching group and select Cancel finding full
          text.

Improving the Search for Full Text
  These are suggestions for improving the accuracy of the Find Full Text feature:

      ▪ Make sure you are IP authenticated to access any premium full text resources to which you would
         like EndNote to attempt connecting.

      ▪ Ask your librarian whether your institution is set up with Web of Science Core Collection journal links.
         If so, create a free personalized Web of Science Core Collection account and log in. If your institution
         does not have custom journal links set up for Web of Science Core Collection, ask your librarian to
         set it up (it is easy and free).

      ▪ Create a free EndNote account and log in. Enhanced EndNote Web/online is included for three-
         years with EndNote. Make sure your EndNote account information is complete under EndNote
         Preferences (Edit > Preferences > Sync).

      ▪ Review your EndNote references to confirm that the DOI information is in the DOI field. If it is not,
         data for multiple records can be moved between fields with the Change/Move/Copy Fields…
         command from the Library menu. (See Move/Copy Fields.)

      ▪ Enable Web browser cookies.
  If you would like Find Full Text to search a specific institutional library, see Adding Access to Your
  Institution's Library.


Finding Related Online References
  If Find Full Text is unable to find and download the PDF you need, you may still be able to access it using
  the OpenURL Link command. OpenURL Link connects to an OpenURL standard syntax server and uses
  EndNote’s OpenURL preferences along with data in your EndNote record to find related online references.

  Highlight a reference in EndNote and use the URL > OpenURL Link command on the References menu to
  start your default web browser and display the full text article (if available) plus a list of links to similar
  articles.

   Note: This command has no relation to the URL field found in EndNote references or to the URL > Open
   Link command on the References menu (which opens the specific URL found in the URL field).

  To enable this feature, and find out what preferences are available, see URLs and Links Preferences.


Adding Access to Your Institution's Library
  Many libraries are accessible with an OpenURL Path. Subscription libraries also require valid authentication,
  which usually means a user ID and password. First, you must determine the appropriate OpenURL path. If
  the library requires authentication, you must also determine the authentication URL. Next, enter these URLs
  as Find Full Text preferences. Then, you may need to authenticate access by entering your personal user ID
  and password. These definitions may be helpful to you:

  OpenURL Path: This is the OpenURL web address to the online library. It is where EndNote will be directed
  to search for matching references.




      Page 142 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


  Authentication URL: This is the web address to the page where you enter subscription details to access
  the online library. It is typically the page where you enter a user name and password. Once you enter the
  Authentication URL (if required), EndNote can access the full text of the matching references from the online
  library’s OpenURL path.

  Proxy Server: Your institution may use a proxy server to control access. For EndNote to automatically
  handle the proxy server when accessing http-based connections, you will need to configure your proxy
  settings. You can do this for Windows by opening Settings > Network & Internet > Proxy. Check your
  institutional library's website, or ask your librarian or network administrator, for information on what the
  settings should be for your institution's proxy server.


Determining the OpenURL Path
  The easiest way to determine your institution’s OpenURL address is to ask your librarian, or check the
  library's website.

  SFX link resolvers work best, so look for a URL that begins with http://sfx.library or a similar URL that
  contains sfx in the path.


Determining the Authentication URL
  In order to use the OpenURL path to find full text articles, your institution likely requires that you log in to
  access full text. EndNote uses an authentication URL to automatically direct you to your institution’s log-in
  web page.

  Again, the easiest way to determine the authentication URL is to work with your librarian or check your
  library's website. To act as your own detective, though, you can try the suggestion below.

  To determine the authentication URL:

      1. Enter the OpenURL path as an EndNote preference.

          a. From the Edit menu, select Preferences.

          b. Select the Find Full Text panel.

          c. Select the OpenURL box, and enter the OpenURL Path information.

          d. Click OK to save the setting.

      2. Then try one of these:

          a. Follow the URL Path:
               (1) Highlight a reference—one where you believe the full text article is available from your
                   institution.
               (2) Right-click on the reference and select References > URL > OpenURL Link. If you are not
                   automatically directed to the full text article, use your browser to continue to try to get to
                   the full text PDF file.

          b. Browse to the URL:
               (1) Use a browser to go to your library’s Web site and try to access a subscription resource.




      Page 143 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


                (2) Once you reach a page where you are prompted to enter credentials, copy the root of that
                    URL. It may start with https://login.ezproxy. Copy everything through “/login? url=%@”.
                (3) Enter the path as an authentication preference as described next under Setting Full Text
                    Preferences.
                (4) Test the URL by logging in to your institution’s site as described below.


Setting Full Text Preferences
   Once you have determined the appropriate OpenURL path and authentication URL for your institution, you
   must enter them as preferences in EndNote.

   To enter Find Full Text preferences:

      1. From the Edit menu, select Preferences.

      2. Select the Find Full Text panel.

          This panel determines which methods are used when searching for full text articles. By default,
          PubMed, the Web of Science Core Collection Full Text Links, DOI, and OpenURL are selected.

      3. To search your institution’s library, make sure OpenURL is selected, and enter your institution’s
         OpenURL Path. If authentication is required, enter an Authentication URL (the address of the site’s
         login page).

   For more information, see Find Full Text Preferences.


Logging in to Your Library
   Once you have entered the appropriate URLs as Find Full Text preferences, you can log into your
   institution’s library. Do this in one of two ways:

Authenticate Only

      1. From the References menu, select Find Full Text and then Authenticate.

      2. This method allows you to try connecting without starting a Find Full Text search. You should be
         directed to your institution’s login web page. Log in as indicated on the web page. You may be
         directed to a home page or a list of resources, which means you are logged in. Click Done. You are
         authenticated for this session of EndNote or until your institution times out the connection.

      3. You still need to specifically select the References > Find Full Text > Find Full Text command to
         begin searching for full text articles.

Authenticate and Search

      1. From the References menu, select Find Full Text, and then Find Full Text.

      2. If you have an OpenURL path and authentication URL entered under Find Full Text preferences,
         EndNote will direct you to your institution’s login web page. Log in as indicated on the web page, and
         then click Continue to begin the search for full text articles for the selected references.

   You are authenticated for this session of EndNote or until your institution times out the connection.

   Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


Note: Your institution may sever your OpenURL connection after a certain amount of idle time.
Unfortunately, there is no indication when that happens. You will need to go to the References menu,
select Find Full Text and then Authenticate to restore access to the site. Just selecting Find Full Text
again during this EndNote session will not restore authentication.

Importing Reference Data into EndNote
Retrieving References Directly from Online Databases
  If you have access to a library catalog or bibliographic database that supports the Z39.50 protocol, you can
  use EndNote as a tool to search and retrieve references directly from that database into EndNote. You do
  not need to use EndNote’s Import command. You can use the Online Search command instead. This is the
  easiest way to get data into EndNote because it involves no intermediate steps. For more information about
  the direct retrieval of references, see Searching Online Databases.


Importing Bibliographic Data to EndNote
  There are many sources of bibliographic data that can be used to help you create your EndNote library. To
  avoid retyping this data into EndNote, we have provided several means by which you can get references
  into EndNote:

      ▪ Import PDF files.

      ▪ Import references saved or downloaded from online data services (for example, PubMed or
         Clarivate).

      ▪ Import text files that conform to a particular format (such as the Tab-Delimited or EndNote Import
         format). These files can be created by you or generated from other databases.

      ▪ Import text files exported from other bibliographic software programs.
  For all of these options except importing PDF files, you need to get your data files in the right format (see
  Getting Data in the Right Format), and then determine the correct Import Options.

  Once you have a file in the proper format and you know which import option or filter to use, the import
  instructions are the same for all of these types of data. See Importing Text Files.

   Note: Although we try to provide many flexible ways to get data from other sources into EndNote, we do
   not claim that EndNote can import data from all sources. In some cases, you may have to write your own
   import filter (see Creating a New Filter), or you may need to manipulate the data in a word processor
   before it can be imported. If none of these tools helps you to import your data, tips on how to quickly copy
   and paste data into EndNote are described in Copying and Pasting References from a Document into
   EndNote.


   Note: When importing records, we recommend that you import into a temporary new library, determine
   which ones you want to keep, and then move those records into your permanent library.

   Before you download references from an online source, consider copyright issues.

                            Copyright Issues and Fair Use of Downloaded Data

           EndNote gives you the capability to import references downloaded from online
           databases into its libraries. Some producers of online reference databases expressly
           prohibit such use and storage of their data, others charge an extra fee for a license to
           use the data in this way. Before you download references from a database, be sure to
           carefully check the copyright and fair use notices for the database. Note that different
           databases may have varying restrictions, even from the same information provider.



Importing PDF Files
   If you already have PDF files you have downloaded, or even need a little assistance with finding PDF files
   for references you have discovered online, EndNote can help.

   EndNote can import PDF files, either a single PDF or an entire folder of PDF files. It can even import a
   folder of PDF files with subfolders and create a group set for the main folder and custom groups for the
   subfolders.


EndNote Click
   EndNote Click is a free browser plugin that finds the best available PDF of an academic article while you
   browse. Behind the scenes, EndNote Click will search open databases and (where possible) your
   university's subscriptions to find the best version of the paper for you.

Download and Install the EndNote Click Plugin

   The EndNote Click plugin is available for Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Opera (for Opera you must first
   install the Chrome Extensions for Opera, then download the plugin for Chrome). Download ind install the
   plugin according to the requirements for your browser.

       ▪ Download EndNote Click for Chrome.
       ▪ Download EndNote Click for Microsoft Edge.

Create Your EndNote Click Account

   The first time you click on the EndNote Click button in your browser, you will be directed to log in or create
   an account. You must create an account to use EndNote Click.

   After creating your account, you will be shown a set of customization options. Select EndNote as your
   citation management software to enable quick integration for downloading PDF files to EndNote or pushing
   them to EndNote online.

On-Campus Access

   EndNote Click automatically detects your library subscriptions when you are on campus based on your IP
   address. You don't need to do anything.




       Page 147 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


Off-Campus Access

   If your library supports off-campus access to subscriptions via EZproxy, OpenAthens, or Shibboleth,
   EndNote Click can connect through these. You will need to log in to your library the first time you use
   EndNote Click off-campus.

    Note: Neither Clarivate nor EndNote Click receive or store a user's institutional credentials. Credentials
    are stored in the Web browser, just like any other set of stored credentials, and EndNote Click simply
    uses them when attempting to retrieve fee-paid journal articles when the user is off-site.


Using EndNote Click to Import PDF Files into EndNote

   As you are browsing the web, EndNote Click will be searching for available PDF files matching the articles
   you are looking at. When it finds one, it will show a button similar to the one below in the lower left corner of
   the window.




   To download the PDF to EndNote:

      1. Click the View PDF button. The PDF will appear in an online viewer and a panel with options will
         appear at the left.

      2. Select Export to EndNote Desktop to send the PDF and it's related bibliographic data to your
         desktop library. (Depending on your browser settings, you may be asked what to do with the
         downloaded file, to open it or to save it. If asked, open the file with EndNote.) An EndNote reference
         will appear in the temporary Imported References group, and the PDF will be attached.

    Note: The EndNote reference will have the basic information, but there may be additional information
    available. Try using the References > Find Reference Updates command to find missing information and
    add it to the reference.


Importing PDF Files to Create New References
   This feature allows you to convert existing collections of PDF files into EndNote references with minimal
   typing or copying by extracting the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) from the PDF file. The system matches DOI
   information with data available from CrossRef (https://www.crossref.org/), capturing bibliographic content
   and creating new EndNote references.

   To import a PDF file:

      1. Open the library into which you want to import the references.

      2. From the File menu, select Import > File.

      3. Click the Choose button.

      4. Locate the PDF file you want to import. Select the file and click Open.

      5. Select PDF from the Import Option list.

     6. Select an option from the Duplicates list:

         ▪ Import All: Imports all references, including duplicates.

         ▪ Discard Duplicates: Imports all references except duplicates.

         ▪ Import into Duplicates Library: Duplicate references are imported into a library called File-
            Dupl.enl, where ”File" is the name of the library into which you are importing.

  By default, a reference is considered a duplicate when the Author, Year, Title, and Reference Type match a
  reference already in the library. See Duplicates Preferences if you would like to change the duplicates
  criteria.

     7. Select No Translation for the Text Translation option.

     8. Click Import to import the file.

   Note: See Importing PDF Folders to Create New References for instructions on how to import multiple
   PDF files stored within a single folder.


   Note: When performing the import function, if there are two DOIs found in the first two pages of a PDF
   document, EndNote will put at least one DOI in the DOI field for data extraction. The PDF is then attached
   and the file name is put in the Title field.

  When the import is complete, the new record is stored in the temporary Imported References group, and will
  include bibliographic information given for the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) mined from the PDF file
  metadata, such as title, author, volume, issue, page, year, and DOI. You may be able to find more
  information for the record using the Find Reference Updates command.

  The Imported References group is a temporary group that is replaced each time you import another set of
  references. It is removed when you exit EndNote (although the references remain in the library).

  To return all of your references to the library display (including the newly imported ones), click the All
  References group.


Importing PDF Folders to Create New References
  This feature allows you to convert existing collections of PDF files into EndNote records with minimal typing
  or copying by extracting Digital Object identifiers (DOI) from PDF files. The system matches DOI information
  with data available from CrossRef (https://www.crossref.org/), capturing bibliographic content and creating
  new EndNote records.

  To import a PDF folder with PDF files:

     1. Open the EndNote library into which you want to import the references.

     2. From the File menu, select Import > Folder to open the Import Folder dialog.

     3. Click the Choose button. Navigate to the needed folder.

     4. Select the needed PDF folder, and then click OK.

     5. If the selected folder lists subfolders, click the Include files in subfolders checkbox to include PDF
        files in those subfolders in the import operation.

      Page 149 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


     6. If you would like EndNote to create a group set for the main folder and groups within it for the
        subfolders, mark the box Create a Group Set for this import.

     7. Select the PDF option from the Import Option list. (It will be the only option available.)

     8. Select an option from the Duplicates list:

         ▪ Import All: Imports all references, including duplicates.

         ▪ Discard Duplicates: Imports all references except duplicates.

         ▪ Import into Duplicates Library: Duplicate references are imported into a library called File-
            Dupl.enl, where ”File" is the name of the library into which you are importing.

              By default, a reference is considered a duplicate when the Author, Year, Title, and Reference
              Type match a reference already in the library. See Duplicates Preferences if you would like to
              change the duplicates criteria.

     9. Click the Import button to import the PDF files from the selected folder to your library.

   Note: See Importing PDF Files to Create New References for instructions on how to import a single PDF
   file.


   Note: When performing the import function, if there are two DOIs found in the first two pages of a PDF
   document, EndNote will put at least one DOI in the DOI field for data extraction. The PDF is then attached
   and the file name is put in the Title field.

  When the import is complete, the new record is stored in the temporary Imported References group, and will
  include bibliographic information given for the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) mined from the PDF file
  metadata, such as title, author, volume, issue, page, year, and DOI. You may be able to find more
  information for the record using the Find Reference Updates command.

  The Imported References group is a temporary group that is replaced each time you import another set of
  references. It is removed when you exit EndNote (although the references remain in the library).

  To return all of your references to the library display (including the newly imported ones), click the All
  References group.


Importing References Downloaded from Online Databases
  If you have access to an online bibliographic database or university catalog, you can probably use
  EndNote’s import filters to import text files saved or downloaded from these sources. EndNote filters are
  configurable so they give you the flexibility to import the reference data you need, and eliminate data you do
  not need.

  There are two main things you need to know in order to correctly import downloaded references into
  EndNote:

     1. How to download the data in the right output format. See Getting Data in the Right Format.

     2. Which import filter to use to import the data into EndNote. See Choosing the Correct Import Filter.




      Page 150 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


Importing Text Files
   EndNote can import structured text files to create new references in your library. This method of importing is
   extremely flexible. You can create your own structured files for importing, and your own import filters, as well
   as importing data from hundreds of online databases. This method also has the advantage of letting you
   remove duplicates of references already in your library during the import process.

    Note: See Importing EndNote Libraries for specific instructions about merging two EndNote libraries by
    importing one library into another. For another method of merging EndNote libraries, see Merging
    Libraries through Sync.

   To import a text file into an EndNote library:

      1. Open the library into which you want to import the references.

      2. From the File menu, select Import > File.

      3. Click the Choose button.

      4. Locate the file you want to import. All files, except for EndNote libraries and PDFs, must be plain text
         files. (The exception to this "plain text" rule is EndNote-generated XML files. See Exporting to
         EndNote XML for information an creating EndNote XML files.) Select the file and click Open.

      5. Select the appropriate filter from the Import Option list. Filters are the customizable files EndNote
         uses to import text files. See Import Options for more information on available filters. See Creating a
         New Filter for information on creating your own custom filters.

      6. Select an option from the Duplicates list:

           ▪ Import All: Imports all references, including duplicates.

           ▪ Discard Duplicates: Imports all references except duplicates.

           ▪ Import into Duplicates Library: Duplicate references are imported into a library called File-
              Dupl.enl, where ”File" is the name of the library into which you are importing.

           By default, a reference is considered a duplicate when the Author, Year, Title, and Reference Type
           match a reference already in the library. See Duplicates Preferences if you would like to change the
           duplicates criteria.

      7. Select a Text Translation option.

          This option allows you to specify the text character encoding of the file you import, so that extended
          characters transfer correctly. You should verify the setting with your database provider. Some U.S.
          databases that contain extended characters require ANSI-Latin1 or UTF8. MARC format files may
          require ANSEL translation. You might be able to use No Translation for text files that do not contain
          any extended characters.

      8. Click Import to import the file.

    Note: The time required to import a file is proportionate to the size of the library and the number of
    references being imported. Refer to the progress indicator to determine when EndNote has completed the
    task.



       Page 151 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


  When the import is complete, the newly imported references are displayed in a temporary Imported
  References group. This is a perfect time to add a keyword to each imported reference with the Change/
  Move/Copy Fields (see Change Fields) command or to peruse the imported data to make sure it imported
  as expected. Make sure to check references that contain extended characters.

  The Imported References group is a temporary group that is replaced each time you import another set of
  references. It is removed when you exit EndNote (although the references remain in the library).

  To return all of your references to the library display (including the newly imported ones), click on the All
  References group.


Import Options
  EndNote's import options include:

      ▪ PDF File or Folder: Use to import references from a PDF file that has been downloaded to your
         hard drive. This option allows you to convert existing collections of PDF files into EndNote records
         with minimal typing or copying by extracting Digital Object identifiers (DOI) from PDF files. The
         system matches the content against the existing API services by capturing bibliographic content and
         creating new EndNote records. See Importing PDF Folders and Importing PDF Files to Create New
         References for specific instructions.

      ▪ EndNote Library: Used to import references from one EndNote library into another. If the library you
         are importing from is closed or locked, all references are imported. If the library you are importing
         from is open, with read/write access, the showing references are imported. See Importing EndNote
         Libraries.

      ▪ EndNote Import: Used to import text files that have been downloaded from online databases or
         exported from EndNote using the EndNote format. See Creating a Tagged EndNote Import File for
         more information.

      ▪ Refer/BibIX: Used to import text files exported from the Refer or BibIX programs. The EndNote
         import format is based on the Refer/BibIX format.

      ▪ Tab-Delimited: Used to import text files in which the fields within a single reference are separated by
         tabs. For details see Creating a Tab-Delimited Format.

      ▪ Reference Manager (RIS): Used to import text files exported from Reference Manager or any other
         source that uses the RIS format. See Converting a Reference Manager Database to EndNote if you
         need to convert a Reference Manager database.

      ▪ ISI-CE: Used to import text files downloaded from Web of Science Core Collection and other
         Clarivate sources.

          Note: See Searching the Web of Science Platform for information about directly retrieving Web of
          Science Core Collection records.


      ▪ Multi-Filter (Special): A special option for importing files that include references from multiple
         sources (see Identifiers).

      ▪ EndNote Generated XML: Used to import EndNote’s proprietary XML format.




      Page 152 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       ▪ Other Filters: EndNote includes hundreds of import filters configured to import data from a variety of
          online databases. Most likely, the first time you import a file, you will not see the import filter that you
          need in this list. Select Other Filters from the Import Option list to find the filter that matches the
          source of the data you want to import. Import filters that you have recently used or chosen as your
          favorites will be listed in the Import Option list in the Import dialog.

          See Choosing the Correct Import Filter for information about how to choose the filters to appear in
          the Import Option list.

       ▪ Use Connection File: EndNote provides the option of using a connection file as an import filter. This
          is useful if you need to import the Connection.log file generated by using EndNote’s Online Search
          command to search an online database. The Connection.log file should include all of the references
          from your previous session. See The Connect Log File for more information.

    Note: See Introduction to Filters for information about creating and modifying import filters. All of the
    import filters (except Tab Delimited and EndNote Generated XML) can be modified.


Choosing the Correct Import Filter
   Once you have captured and saved your data file in the appropriate format, you should identify the proper
   EndNote filter to import the data. There are hundreds of filters included with EndNote, each designed to
   read a specific tagged format from a specific information provider.

   To see a complete list of filters installed for your copy of EndNote, select Import Filters from the Tools menu,
   and select Open Filter Manager. You may see many filters with the same name, but from different data
   providers. Be sure to select the filter that matches both the database and the data provider you are working
   with or your data will not import correctly.

   Use the Find by button in the Filter Manager to find all filters for a particular information provider. You can
   click the More Info button to display additional information about a selected filter. The Comments section
   may provide information about how to appropriately download information from the source database.

   When you have located the filters you want to use, mark them as your favorites by clicking the checkbox in
   the Favorites column to the left of the filter name. You can also mark all of the filters currently showing after
   using the Find option by clicking Mark All. Once a filter is marked as a favorite, it will appear in the Import
   Option list in the import dialog.

    Note: There are many more databases and services that provide data than there are filters included with
    EndNote, so in some cases you may need to write your own filter or modify one of ours. See Introduction
    to Filters for information about creating and modifying filters. You can also check our Web site periodically
    for new and updated filters (Download EndNote Import Filters).


Comparing a Filter to a Data File

   If you are uncertain whether a filter matches a data file that you have downloaded, you can compare the
   format from your downloaded data file to the filter. To do so, select a filter in the Filter Manager, and click the
   Edit button. When the Filter window opens, select the Templates option in the list at the left of the window to
   display the tags recognized by that filter.

   The tags and templates in the filter should match the data in the file you want to import. See The Basic
   Components of a Filter for information about editing filters.




       Page 153 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


Changing the Filter Folder

   By default, all filters provided with EndNote are stored in the Filters folder found in the EndNote program
   folder. These are the filters displayed when you open the Filter Manager. EndNote also displays filters found
   in your personal Filters folder.

   When you create a new filter, it is saved to your personal Filters folder. When you attempt to save changes
   to an existing filter, you must use Save As to save a copy to your personal Filters folder. For more
   information about your personal folders, and information about how to change the location of your personal
   folders, see Folder Locations Preferences.

     12. Select an option from the Duplicates list:

          ▪ Import All: Imports all references, including duplicates.

          ▪ Discard Duplicates: Imports all references except duplicates.

          ▪ Import into Duplicates Library: Duplicate references are imported into a library called File-
             Dupl.enl, where ”File" is the name of the library into which you are importing.




       Page 154 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


           By default, a reference is considered a duplicate when the Author, Year, Title, and Reference Type
           match a reference already in the library. See Duplicates Preferences if you would like to change the
           duplicates criteria.

     13. Select No Translation for the Text Translation option.

     14. Click Import to import the file. The references will appear in the Imported References temporary
         group.

To Import References with Direct Export

      1. Open the library into which you want to import the references.

      2. Go to the PubMed Web site in your Web browser at https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/.

      3. In the Search field, enter your search criteria. (To create an advanced search, click the Advanced
         button.) To execute your search, click the Search button.

      4. Select the needed results and then click the Send To button.

      5. Select Citation Manager from the list.

      6. Click the Create File button. This will save the references in a format that works with EndNote's
         Direct Export feature.

      7. The references should appear in the temporary Imported References group of your library. If the
         references do not appear in your library, go to your browser's download location and double-click the
         file ending with the .nbib extension. The .nbib extension indicates the PubMed file format compatible
         with Direct Export.

    Note: Whether a file is recognized as being a Direct Export file type and opens in EndNote automatically
    can be affected by your browser and/or operating system settings for how file types are associated with
    programs. See Enabling Direct Export if PubMed files are not automatically added to your library with
    these Direct Export instructions.



Creating Structured Text Files that EndNote Can Import
   What do you do if your data is not in a format that EndNote can automatically import? You can do one of
   several things (or even a combination these options):

       ▪ Try searching for the references in another online database that might provide an importable format.

       ▪ Rearrange the reference data using your word processor so that it is in a format that EndNote can
          import (one of the two options listed at the end of this topic).

       ▪ Copy and paste each piece of data from its source into the proper fields in EndNote, as described in
          Copying and Pasting References from a Document into EndNote.

       ▪ Enter the data manually by typing it into EndNote as described in Entering References.
   Creating a file that EndNote can import can be a lot of work if your data is in an arbitrary or inconsistent
   format. If you only have a few references to import (less than 30 or 40), it might be faster and easier to
   retype them or copy and paste the references than to try to put them into a format that EndNote can import.

      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


  However, if you have many references to import, it might save time to first manipulate the data in a word
  processor as best you can, and then import the references into EndNote and clean up the references there.
  Even if the imported data does not come through perfectly, it can be rearranged with EndNote’s various
  commands, drag-and-drop, and copy and paste, or it might be possible to update the data using Find
  Reference Updates if it is fairly accurate.

  These are two different formats that you can put your data into that will allow it to be imported into EndNote:

      ▪ A tab-delimited format. This is best if your data is in a database or spreadsheet that can export to a
         tab-delimited file. See Creating a Tab-Delimited Format.

      ▪ A tagged format. This is best for when your data is in a word processor document and looks like a
         bibliography. See Creating a Tagged EndNote Import File.

   Note: To allow for the appropriate import of Unicode characters, save word-processing files as Unicode
   Text (UTF-8).


Getting Data in the Right Format
  To import text with any of the EndNote filters, the data must be consistently "tagged," with each tag starting
  on a new line, and the file saved as text. Here are two examples:

         AU- CRAMER, JOHN
         TI- AQUATIC
         PY- 1993
         SO- ENVIRONMENTAL-POLLUTION. VOL. 5, NO. 2, PG.54-79
         DE- LAKES, ACIDIFICATION, ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS, MACROPHYTES, ECOLOGY,
         PLANT PHYSIOLOGY

         Author:   Cramer, John
         Title:    Aquatic macrophytes and lake acidification
         Year:     1993
         Source:   Environmental Air Pollution. Vol. 5(2) pp.54-79
         Keywords: lakes--acidification--environmental

   Note: If data is inconsistently tagged, or poorly delimited, it may not be possible to import all the data
   accurately. See A Comment About Difficult Data Files.

  If references are sent to you in the body of an email as tagged text, save the email to a plain text file.


Creating a Tagged EndNote Import File
  The EndNote Import format is a tagged format based on the rules of the Refer/BibIX format. In this format,
  each field of data (that is, Journal, Volume, or Title) is preceded by an identifying tag: a percent sign (%)
  followed by a single capital letter, a number, or a special character, plus a space. Entire references are
  separated by one blank line:

Author Names in the EndNote Import Format

       ▪ Author names use the %A tag. This tag should repeat for each author, with the names listed one per
          line:

              %A   Jones, Mary
              %A   Simon, Jeff

       ▪ Author names can appear either as:
              Geoffrey Chaucer
              or
              Chaucer, Geoffrey

       ▪ Either initials or full names are accepted.

Defining Reference Types

   Set the reference type for each of the imported references by using %0 (zero) and the reference type name.

   The default reference types are listed below. If you have modified a reference type, your EndNote data files
   should use the new name instead.

Creating a Custom "Tagged" Format
  If you have a large bibliography that you would like to import into EndNote, it may be possible to use your
  word processor’s Find and Replace commands to insert descriptive tags in front of some of the fields of data
  so that EndNote can accurately import the references. In addition to adding tags, you also need to make a




      Page 160 of 631
    Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


filter to read your tags. (See Choosing the Correct Import Filter for information about using a predefined
EndNote Import format if you would rather not create your own filter.)

This topic outlines the basic steps to convert a bibliography into a tagged text file.

Step 1. Save a Copy of Your File

    ▪ Open your bibliography in a word processor and save a copy of the file with a new name (this is your
        backup).

    ▪ Remove everything but the reference data from the file.
Step 2. Add Descriptive Field Tags

Use your word processor’s Find and Replace commands to search for unique delimiters between fields, and
insert paragraph marks and descriptive field tags in front of specific fields. For this example, we will show a
very simple case where only the start of each reference is tagged, and the filter does the rest of the work.
This works well for reference lists that have clear delimiters separating the individual components of the
reference (author, year, title, and so on). In some cases, you may have better results making additional
replacements in the text file before importing. The more tags you add to your data, the greater degree of
accuracy you can get with the import filter.

Suppose your references look like this:

     Jones, M. (2020) "Quail Intelligence" Avian Science. Vol. 3 no. 2.

     Billoski, K. (2012) "Parakeet Smarts" Avian Digest. Vol. 23 no.5.

The process of converting this bibliographic format to a tagged format would be something like this:

    ▪ Search for 2 paragraph marks (since the references are separated by 1 blank line), and replace with
        two paragraph marks and a tag "XX-" followed by a space.

The result is a tagged data file that looks like this:

     XX- Jones, M. (2020) "Quail Intelligence" Avian Science. Vol. 3, no. 2.

     XX- Billoski, K. (2012) "Parakeet Smarts" Avian Digest. Vol. 23, no.5.

Once you have made all the changes to tag as much of the data as necessary, save the file (as a plain text
file), and create an import filter to match the tags and formats of the references.

Step 3: Create a Filter for Non-Delimited Data

Using EndNote, create a new filter to read your data file (see Creating a New Filter). The template of a filter
for the above data file would look like this example.

         Tag            Field

         XX-            Author (Year) "Title" Journal. Vol. Volume no. Issue.

Each field listed for the Tag must appear in each of your references. If a reference field is missing, all of the
data will appear in a previous field. For instance, if you were using the above reference format and a Volume
field was not present, the filter would place the Issue data in the Journal field.




    Page 161 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   To resolve this issue, each iteration of a reference must be entered into the filter according to a hierarchy of
   formats (longest is always on top).

        XX- Author (Year) "Title" Journal. |Vol. Volume no. Issue|.
        XX- Author (Year) "Title" Journal. |Vol. Volume|.
        XX- Author (Year) "Title" Journal. |`DOI:`DOI|.

   To ensure that each source line is imported into your library during import even if it does not match one of
   the templates you set up, you can turn on the Import Source Into option from the Source Parsing option in
   the filter. Just identify your source tag, then select import source into and select a field.

   Step 4: Clean Up the Data

   After you set up your file with tags and create a filter to import it, you should test and refine the filter by
   importing into a new library. Once your filter is working as you would like it, you can use it to import the data
   file into your real EndNote library.

   If you cannot get the filter to import everything exactly as you want, you may have to do some manual
   editing to correct this, either before or after importing the data into EndNote. You might find it useful to
   import into a test library, then use the Change Fields, Move/Copy Fields, and Find and Replace options to
   clean up the data. Then, transfer these references to your real library with drag-and-drop, copy and paste,
   or the Import command.


Creating a Tab-Delimited Format
   The Tab-delimited import option can import text files in which each reference is separated by a paragraph
   break (¶), and the fields within a reference are separated by tabs. Most databases or spreadsheets can
   export a tab-delimited text file.

Preparing the Data Before Exporting

Author Names

   Before you export data from a database or spreadsheet into a text file, we recommend that you separate
   multiple author names with a semicolon (;) or two forward slashes (//). For example:

        McCartney, P.//Harrison, G.//Lennon, J.

   If you cannot easily do this in your database, you can do it after exporting or manually edit the data after it is
   in EndNote.

Reference Types

   If possible, you should make sure that each reference in your tab-delimited file includes a field indicating the
   reference type. Use EndNote’s Reference Type names so that EndNote is able to recognize the formats. If
   you have only one type of reference (such as Journal Articles), it is not necessary to do this—the import
   settings can indicate that all references should be imported as the same type.

   If you cannot label each reference with the appropriate Reference Type name, you should export your data
   into separate files based on reference type. This makes it easy to preserve the original reference types of
   the references when importing the data files into EndNote.




       Page 162 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


Paragraph/Line Breaks within Records

   Each reference must end with a paragraph mark. There should be no paragraph marks or line breaks within
   a reference. For example, spreadsheet programs such as Excel will allow you to enter line breaks within a
   cell. When saved as a tab-delimited file, these line breaks may be interpreted as the end of a record,
   breaking the reference into separate EndNote references.

Preparing the Data File for Import

   Once the tab-delimited file(s) are generated, you must open each file in a text editor or word processor and
   add two lines to it. These lines tell EndNote what the reference type is for the data and how the data should
   be interpreted.

First Line: The Default Reference Type

   If all the references in the file are for the same reference type, the first line of the file must define the default
   reference type for the entire file. The format for the first line is an asterisk (*) immediately followed by a valid
   EndNote reference type, followed by a paragraph break (shown below as <¶>). For example:

        *Journal Article<¶>

   The second line should contain the field names used for that reference type. A file of journal articles would
   contain the fields used in the Journal Article reference type. It might look like this:

   *Journal Article<¶>
   Author          <tab> Year <tab> Title          <tab> Journal        <tab> Volume <¶>
   Jones, J//                           Easy               J. of

                                          Default

First Line: A Custom Reference Type

   Just like when importing a tab-delimited file for a standard reference type, the field names for a custom
   reference type must match the reference type, so you will need to know the field names you used in your
   custom reference type. To find them, follow these instructions.

      1. Select Preferences from the Edit menu.

      2. Select Reference Types.

      3. Click the Modify Reference Types button. Find your custom reference type and make a note all the
         fields used in it.

    Note: You can find templates of all the reference types using the List of Reference Types. These
    templates can be printed out to help you record changes you make to the reference types.

   A file for which you are using a custom reference type as the default might look like this:

     Note: Ensure that the field names that appear in the second line match those assigned to your custom
     reference type. In the example above "My Reference Type" would the name of the custom reference type,
     and "F1," "F2," etc. would be the name of the fields used in the custom reference type. Tabs are indicated
     by "<tab>" in the examples above.


First Line: Using Multiple Reference Types

    If you could not make separate files based on reference type, you can specify each reference type within
    one file. In this case, your first line must be an asterisk (*), followed by "Generic" and a paragraph mark.
    then the list of field names found in the Generic reference type, starting with a field for "Reference Type."
    Use the Reference Type column to define the actual EndNote reference type names. For example:

   *Generic<¶>
   Reference
                 <tab> Author       <tab> Year <tab> Title          <tab> Publisher <¶>
   Type
                                                         Easy
   Book          <tab> Jones, J     <tab> 1994 <tab>                <tab> Avalon       <¶>
                                                         Food
   Book                  Woo, W//                        Rain
                 <tab>              <tab> 1995 <tab>                <tab> Nourse       <¶>
   Section               Lee, L                          Hats
   Web Page      <tab> Carlos, C <tab> 2020 <tab> EndNote <tab> Clarivate <¶>
                 Tab-Delimited File Example with No Default Reference Type


     Note: Ensure that the generic field names for the reference type (Modify Reference Types dialog) appear
     in line 2. In the examples above, note that in the first example for the standard Journal Article reference
     type there is a "Journal" field name, but the Generic name for that field would be"Secondary Title." When
     importing multiple reference types, "Secondary Title" would appear in the field names, not "Journal."


Second Line: EndNote Field Names

    As stated above, the second line of the tab-delimited file must contain the actual field names used by
    EndNote. The order of the field names does not matter as long as they correspond to the order of the data
    in the rows beneath them and correspond to the names of the default reference type (or to the generic
    names when importing multiple reference types).

    For example, if your default reference type is "*Journal Article," the field names in the second line of your file
    will be those of the Journal Article reference type:

   *Journal Article<¶>
   Author          <tab> Year <tab> Title         <tab> Journal         <tab> Volume <¶>

    Note: The field names must be separated by tabs and a paragraph break must follow the last field name.


Additional Considerations

       ▪ ANSI, ASCII, or UTF-8 formatted plain text files can be imported. This means that no font styles or
          text styles can be preserved during import.

       ▪ All field names and reference type names in the file must be identical to those in EndNote. See
          the List of Reference Types for a listing of all of the reference types. Use the links in the list to access
          templates showing the field names.

       ▪ Multiple author names should be separated by semicolons (;) or by two forward slashes (//).

       ▪ Fields cannot contain tabs or paragraph marks. Let the lines of data "wrap" to the next line.

       ▪ Leading and trailing spaces are removed during importing.

       ▪ No uppercase or lowercase conversion is made during importing.

       ▪ A reserved field name called "Unused" may be used for data that you do not want imported into
          EndNote.


Importing References from Other Bibliographic Software
Programs
   Many programs include an option to export data in the RIS format, which can easily be imported into
   EndNote. See Importing Text Files for instructions on importing a text file in the RIS format.

   If a program does not include an option to export to the RIS format, information on converting from many
   programs is available at the EndNote Support website.


Copying and Pasting References from a Document into
EndNote
   If you have a bibliography that is too inconsistent or difficult to parse using your word processor (as
   suggested in Creating a Custom Tagged Format), you can use the Copy and Paste commands as an
   alternative method for getting your data into EndNote and still avoid a lot of retyping.

   To transfer the references into EndNote:

      1. Open the list of references in a word processor.



       Page 165 of 631
    Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   2. Select a reference and copy it using the Copy (Ctrl+C) command.

   3. Open your EndNote library, and select New Reference (Ctrl+N) from the References menu to create
      a new reference.

   4. Put the cursor in the Title field of the new reference and select Paste (Ctrl+V) from the Edit menu.

This will paste the entire reference into the Title field of the Reference window. From here, you can drag-
and-drop (or cut and paste) the individual pieces of data into their proper fields. Be sure to remove
extraneous punctuation, and make sure author names are each on a separate line. Follow the guidelines for
Entering References. See Default Reference Type for information about setting a default reference type for
new references.

Term Lists
   Term lists help you automate data entry for the Author, Journals, and Keywords fields. They can maintain
   lists of all the authors and keywords that have been used in your library. The Journals term list can improve
   the consistency of how journal names are formatted in your bibliographies.

   You can also create your own term lists to automate other fields. For example, if you enter book references
   manually a lot, you could add a term list for the Publisher field.


Introduction to Term Lists
   EndNote’s term lists are used to store terms such as keywords, author names, or journal names. You can
   use these stored terms when entering references to improve consistency and accuracy of information in
   your library. You can also use the Journals term list to store abbreviated journal names that EndNote can
   substitute for the full journal name in a bibliography, or to substitute the full name for an abbreviation.

   To get a general sense of how the term lists work, here’s a brief overview of how term lists can be built and
   used for someone with a new EndNote library. With the default term list settings in the preferences, updating
   of terms and auto-completion happen automatically. If you do not like this behavior, you may turn off these
   settings (see Term Lists Preferences).


Term Lists are Automatically Maintained
   When you create a new EndNote library, there are three empty term lists already set up and ready for you to
   use: Authors, Journals, and Keywords. As you enter new references into your library (whether by typing,
   importing, or pasting them) EndNote updates the term lists automatically so that the Authors, Journals, and
   Keywords lists include all of the author names, journal names, and keywords entered into your references.


Term Lists Help with Data Entry
   When you use the New Reference command in the References menu to create new references, you will
   notice two other features associated with the term lists. As you begin entering an author name, EndNote
   attempts to complete the name for you by suggesting the closest matching name in the Authors term list. If
   you enter a new name that is not already in your Author list, the name appears in red text to indicate that it
   is a new addition to the term list. When you save the reference, that new term is added to the list.

   When you are searching for references, you can also open a term list to pick the exact term or name for
   which to search.


Term Lists: Associating Additional Fields

       ▪ Journals Term List: By default, the installed Journal term list is linked to the Journal Article
          reference type. This list allows EndNote to substitute abbreviations for full journal names, or full
          names for abbreviations, in bibliographies. See The Journals Term List for more information.

       ▪ Authors Term List: There are several fields associated with the Authors term list. They include the
          Primary Author, Secondary Author, Tertiary Author, Subsidiary Author, and Translated Author fields.
          You can associate additional fields to the Author term list if you require them.




       Page 167 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      ▪ Keywords Term List: This term list is associated with the Keywords field in an EndNote reference.
         You can associate additional fields with the Keyword term list if you require them.


Important Points About Term Lists
  The following list includes useful information about term lists.

      ▪ Term lists are stored with the library and therefore are specific to only that library.

      ▪ A library must be open before you can edit its term lists.

      ▪ If you enter many references manually, you may find it helpful to create new term lists for things like
         publisher and city names. Up to 31 term lists can be created for any library.

      ▪ There is no limit to the number of terms in a term list.

      ▪ Each term can be up to 253 characters long.

      ▪ Terms can be copied from one list and pasted into another.

      ▪ Entire term lists can be exported and imported.

      ▪ By default, term lists are automatically updated from the terms entered in your references. New
         terms appear in red text in the Reference window. This functionality may be turned off using
         EndNote’s Preferences.

      ▪ Term lists can be "linked" to specific fields so that EndNote associates the correct term list with the
         field you are editing.

      ▪ Term lists can be used with the "Auto-entry" feature on or off. By default, this option is turned on so
         that EndNote will suggest the closest matching term as you type in a reference.

      ▪ The Journals term list stores various forms of journal names that can be used when creating
         bibliographies. EndNote provides fourteen Journals lists (including Humanities, Medical, and
         Chemistry) that can be imported for use with your EndNote libraries. Look in the \
         \EndNote 2025\Terms Lists folder.

      ▪ By default, the installed Journal term list is linked to the Journal Article reference type.

      ▪ There are several fields associated with the Authors term list. They include the Primary Author,
         Secondary Author, Tertiary Author, Subsidiary Author, and Translated Author fields. You can
         associate additional fields to the Author term list if you require them.

      ▪ The Keywords term list is associated with the Keywords field in an EndNote reference. You can
         associate additional fields with the Keyword term list if you require them.


Adding Terms to a Term List
Automatic Updating of Term Lists
  By default, EndNote automatically updates the term lists in a library so they stay current with the data that
  has been entered into the references. If you enter a term into a reference, and that term is not in the



      Page 168 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   associated term list already, the term appears in red text to alert you that you have entered a new term. This
   can help you to maintain a controlled vocabulary for keywords and other terms.

   You can turn off automatic updating of term lists if you do not want to use the term lists at all. You can also
   turn this option off and manually enter terms into your lists as described in the following sections. For
   example, you can manually enter all of the terms you plan to use into a term list before entering references
   into the library. This can be extremely helpful when you have someone else entering data for you and you
   want a specific vocabulary used for keywords or other terms. As references are entered into the EndNote
   library, the term lists can speed data entry, and if a red term appears, the person doing data entry knows
   that they have entered something that was not intended to be a valid term for that field.

Turning Off the Automatic Updating of Term Lists

      1. From the Edit menu, select Preferences.

      2. Select the Term Lists panel.

      3. Click the checkboxes for Update lists when importing or pasting references and Update lists during
         data entry to remove the check mark. The feature will be turned off.

Delimiters

   EndNote has predefined term lists for authors, keywords, and journals. When you enter multiple terms into
   those fields and EndNote updates the term list, it needs to know when one term ends and the next term
   begins. We call the punctuation that separates the terms "delimiters."

   The following information applies when entering data into EndNote manually. For the Author fields, author
   names must always be entered one name per line. Carriage returns (end of line marks) are the only valid
   delimiter for this field. Journals normally have just one journal name per reference in this field, so delimiters
   are not needed here. Keywords are the most complex of the three. By default, EndNote uses carriage
   returns (end of line marks), semicolons, and backslashes (\) as delimiters for the Keywords field. If you
   would like to use other delimiters, see Delimiters Used for Separating Terms.


Using the New Term Command
   To manually add terms to a term list:

      1. From the Library menu, select Open Term Lists and select the term list that you want to modify.

      2. On the Terms tab, click New Term.

      3. Enter the term and click Save Term to add it to the list. You can then replace the text in the dialog
         with a new term and again click Save Term to save the new term to the list.

      4. When you have entered your last new term, click OK to add it to the list and close the New
         Term dialog.

      5. Click Close to dismiss the Terms List dialog.

   If you are entering terms into the Journals term list, you will have options to enter different forms of the
   journal name. See Important Points About Entering Journal Names for more information about using the
   Journal lists.




       Page 169 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   Note: The Save Term (or Save Journal) button is unavailable (dim) if the new term already exists in the
   term list.


Copying Terms Between Lists
  You can copy terms from one list and paste them into another as a way to quickly transfer terms between
  lists. This is particularly useful because term lists are specific to an individual library.

  To copy terms between lists:

     1. From the Library menu, select Open Term Lists, and then select the list with terms you want to copy.
        Hold down the Ctrl key to select multiple terms; use the Shift key to select a range of terms.

     2. Right-click and select Copy from the list, or press Ctrl+C to copy the highlighted term(s).

     3. Open the target list where you want to add the terms.

     4. Click in the list, and then right-click and select Paste, or press Ctrl+V to paste in the term(s).


Copying Terms from Other Sources
  You can copy terms from any text, and paste them into a term list.

  For example, to copy a word from a paper you are writing and paste that word into a term list, first select the
  term in your word processor and copy it. Then switch to EndNote and open the desired term list. Click in the
  list, and then right-click and select Paste, or press Ctrl+V to paste in the term(s).


Manually Updating Term Lists
  To create a term list automatically from words already in your library, use the Update List button on the Term
  Lists dialog. This is useful if you have turned off the preference to automatically update your term lists, or if
  you have received a library from a colleague without a term list, or if you have deleted a term list and wish to
  recreate it.

  The Update List command can apply to just a group or set of search results, or use the All References
  group to apply it to the whole library.


Important Points about the Update List Command

      ▪ Update List does not change the terms in your references; it only adds new terms from your
         references into the term list.

      ▪ Update List does not add duplicate terms to a list.

      ▪ Update List removes leading and trailing spaces, but does not change punctuation.

      ▪ For Update List to update the Journals term list with both a full name and abbreviation, the full name
         must be entered in the Journal field and a consistent abbreviation must be entered in the Alternate
         Journal field. See Journal Names and Updating a Journal List for more information on the special
         needs of the Journals term list.




      Page 170 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      ▪ Update List does not automatically link fields to a term list. For easy data entry, you can link a single
         term list to any number of fields. See Linking Term Lists to Fields.

  To update a term list:

  (If you are updating the Journals list, see Updating a Journal List.)

     1. Select a group to update the terms list from, do a search to create the set of references to update
        from, or manually select a set of references to update from.

     2. From the Library menu, select Define Term Lists… and then select the term list that you would like to
        update.

     3. Click Update List.

     4. The currently linked fields are listed in the dialog as the fields from which EndNote gathers new
        terms. If necessary, remove a field from this list by selecting it and clicking Remove Field; or add a
        new field by selecting it from the Add Field list. Adding or removing field names from this list does not
        affect the links between fields and term lists.

         The Generic field names are used in this dialog. See the List of Reference Types to find the
         corresponding field names for the fields of various reference types.

     5. To update a term list from only the currently selected references in your library, select the Update
        Terms From Selected References option.

     6. Click OK to begin the updating process. When finished, EndNote displays the number of terms
        added to the list. Click OK and the process is complete.

   Note: Pressing Esc stops the update process, but all terms added up to that point are kept in the term list.


Delimiters Used for Separating Terms
  The text used to separate the terms in a particular field is determined by the "Delimiter" settings on the Lists
  tab of the Term Lists dialog (select Define Term Lists from the Library menu).

  If your keywords are separated by a slash, such as:

         Antarctica/ozone/stratosphere

  you should select a slash (/) as the field’s term delimiter. A carriage return is always interpreted as a
  delimiter, so it is not necessary to enter a delimiter for the Author fields or any other field that has terms
  entered one-per-line. If different delimiters are used for the same field in your references, you will need to do
  more than one update process, updating from the references with different delimiters separately.


Cleaning Up After Updating
  Click on the Terms tab, and scroll through the term list to make sure that the Update List command had the
  desired result. If it did not, you can highlight specific terms and remove them by clicking Delete Term.

  After using the Update List command, you might find that due to errors or variations in spelling, you have
  multiple entries for the same term. Scan through the list and delete the unwanted terms.




      Page 171 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


  If necessary, use the Find and Replace command from the Library menu to change all occurrences of a
  term in your library. For example, if both "geochronology" and "geo-chronology" are entered as keywords,
  you can delete the unwanted term "geo-chronology" from the term list, then click on the Reference List, and
  select Find and Replace (Ctrl+R) from the Library menu to change "geo-chronology" to "geochronology"
  throughout the library.


Importing Terms Into Term Lists
  EndNote provides fourteen lists of journal names and abbreviations, including lists for Chemistry, Medicine,
  and the Humanities; all of which are stored in the \\EndNote 2025\Terms Lists folder. If you are interested in
  using these abbreviated forms of the journal names in your bibliographies, you can import them into your
  term lists and adjust your styles to use the abbreviations.

   Note: See List of All Journals Cited in PubMed® for a current list of medical journal names and
   abbreviations, in case you need to add journal names in the medical sciences to the provided list.
   Sometimes you may be told to use the "Index Medicus" journal names. Index Medicus ceased publication
   in 2004 (see the May-June 2004 NLM Technical Bulletin article Index Medicus to Cease as Print
   Publication), so the PubMed list is the current resources for finding official medical abbreviations.

  If you would like to look at the lists before importing them, you may open them in your word processor—but
  do not edit or save them. They must remain tab-delimited text files in order for EndNote to correctly import
  the terms.

  Terms can be imported from any text file that lists the terms one per line. Make sure a carriage return is also
  inserted after the last term in the list. If you create a list of terms in a word processing document, be sure to
  save the list as plain text using the Save As command in your word processor. Then, if your terms include
  extended characters, select the Unicode (UTF-8) encoding option.

  To import a text file that contains terms other than journal names (see Loading Supplied Journal
  Abbreviations for journal names):

     1. From the Library menu, select Define Term Lists and highlight the term list to which you want to add
        terms. Use Create List if you want to create a new list.

     2. Click Import List.

     3. Select the text file to be imported and click Open.

  The new terms are imported and sorted alphabetically into the existing term list. This import must be done
  for each library in which you want to use these terms.


Inserting Terms into References
Suggesting Terms As You Type (Auto-completion)
  If you are entering text into a field that is linked to a term list, EndNote finds the first matching term in the list
  and suggests that as the term you want to enter.

  The suggested text appears highlighted after the cursor. Continue typing until EndNote suggests the correct
  term, and then press Enter or Tab to accept it. (Enter creates another line in the field so that you can enter
  more author names; Tab moves the cursor to the next field in the reference.)



      Page 172 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


  When you enter a term that is not already in the term list, it appears in red to indicate that it is a new term.
  When you save the reference, that term is added to the term list and will no longer display in red.

  These auto-completion term list features may be turned off. To turn off the display of red text, turn off the
  preference to Suggest Terms as You Type. See Term Lists Preferences.


Inserting Terms without Using the Auto-Completion Feature
  If you have turned off the option to suggest terms as you type (auto-completion), you can still insert terms
  into your references manually.

  To insert a term from a Term List window:

     1. Open a reference and position the cursor where you want to add the term.

     2. From the Library menu, select Open Term Lists and select the desired list.

          Or, in an Author, Journal, or Keywords field, press Ctrl+1 to display the appropriate list. (If you create
          a custom term list, the Ctrl+1 command will also work with any field you link to your custom term list.)

     3. Double-click a term to insert it directly into the reference, or select the term(s) and click the Insert
        Term button.

  Terms can also be selected by typing the first few letters of the term, by using the Arrow keys, or by clicking
  on the term with the mouse. Hold down the Ctrl key to select multiple terms. Press Enter to insert the
  selected term or click Insert Term. If multiple terms are selected and inserted, they are listed in the reference
  one per line in alphabetical order.


Using Terms For Searches
  To ensure that you are searching for the correct terms, you can use the term lists with EndNote’s Search
  command. Terms can be entered in the fields on the Advanced Search panel just as they are entered into
  references.

     1. Navigate to the Advanced Search panel, select the field you want to search, and click in the field as
        though to enter data in it.

     2. From the Library menu, select Open Term Lists, and then select a list. Or, in an Author, Journal, or
        Keywords field, press Ctrl+1 to display the appropriate list. (If you create a custom term list,
        the Ctrl+1 command will also work with any field you link to your custom term list.)

     3. Select a term and click Insert Term, or double-click on a term, to insert it into the Search field.

     4. Click Search to search for your references.


Modifying Terms
  Any term in a term list may be modified or deleted without affecting any of the references in the library or
  any links between term lists and fields.

  To edit a term in a term list:




      Page 173 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


     1. From the Library menu, select Open Term Lists and select the list that contains the term to be
        modified.

     2. Select a term, and then click Edit Term. If multiple terms are selected, only the first one opens.

     3. Change the term as necessary and click OK when finished. The modified term replaces the original
        term in the term list. (If the term as it is modified already exists, the OK button will be dim.)

   Notes: Editing a term in a term list does not change all occurrences of that term in your library. Use the
   Find and Replace command from the Library menu to find the old term in your references and replace it
   with the new one.

   You cannot edit a term to change the capitalization. You will need to delete it from the list and add it again
   with the new capitalization.



Deleting Terms
  A term can be deleted by highlighting it in the list and clicking Delete Term. Deleting a term from a term list
  does not remove it from the references in the library. If you later use the Update List command, the term will
  be added to the term list again.


Exporting and Printing Term Lists
  Term lists can be exported and then imported into other term lists as a way to move complete lists from one
  library to another (see Importing Terms Into Term Lists).

  You can also open exported term lists in a word processor to print them.

  To export a term list:

     1. From the Library menu, select Define Term Lists.

     2. Highlight the term list that you want to export.

     3. Click Export List.

     4. Name and select a location for the text file that will be created during the export.

     5. Click Save. The terms are exported to the text file and listed alphabetically, one term per line.

  This file can now be imported into another EndNote term list or opened in a word processor to be printed.
  Term lists cannot be printed directly from EndNote.


Predefined Term Lists
  Three empty term lists are available by default with every library: Authors, Journals, and Keywords. These
  lists are already linked to their corresponding fields: the Authors term list is linked to the Author, Secondary
  Author, Tertiary Author, Subsidiary Author, and Translated Author fields; the Journals term list is linked to the
  Secondary Title and Alternate Title fields; and the Keywords term list is linked to the Keywords field.

Defining Term Lists
   Use the Define Term Lists command in the Library menu to create, rename, or delete a term list. This
   command is also used to specify the punctuation that separates individual terms in a reference (delimiters).


Creating a New Term List
   To create a new term list:

      1. From the Library menu, select Define Term Lists.

      2. Click Create List, and then enter the name for the new list. You cannot create a term list with the
         same name as an existing term list.

      3. Click OK.

      4. Check the "Journal List" box only if you want to create a term list for storing journal names and
         abbreviations. These different forms of the journal name can be used interchangeably when creating
         bibliographies. See Creating Bibliographies with Journal Abbreviations.

          The predefined Journals term list is already set up as a multi-column list. If you delete this list, you
          can create another one as described here, but there can only be one Journals term list in a library.
          Do not create a 4-column journal list for nonjournal fields.

   To add terms to the list, you can import an existing list of terms, update the list from existing EndNote field
   data, or manually enter terms into the list.

    Note: New term lists must be linked to fields for the "Suggest terms as you type" and automatic updating
    features to work. See Linking Term Lists to Fields.


Linking Term Lists to Fields
   Term lists are associated with fields using the Link Term Lists command from the Library menu. When a
   term list is linked to a field, the list can be used to facilitate data entry. EndNote can also keep the term lists
   current by automatically adding new terms from linked fields. By linking term lists to particular fields, you can
   use the auto-completion (Suggest terms as you type) feature whenever you are entering data into the linked
   field. Each field can be linked to only one term list. However, you can link the same term list to multiple
   fields.

   The three predefined term lists (Authors, Journals, and Keywords) are already linked to their corresponding
   fields. Any new term list that you create is not linked to a field until you set up the links. The links between
   term lists and fields are specific to each library.

   To change these settings or to link a new term list to one or more fields:

      1. Open a library.

      2. From the Library menu, select Link Term Lists.

      3. If you have more than one library open, select a library from the drop-down list at the top of the
         dialog.



       Page 175 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


     4. The names of the available term lists appear next to the field names with which they are linked. You
        may change the links here as necessary by selecting a different term list from the drop-down lists. A
        field can only be linked to one term list.

     5. Click OK to save your changes and close the dialog.

  These changes will not alter any data that is currently entered in either your references or your term lists.
  Term lists may be linked to multiple fields.

   Note: After linking a term list to one or more fields, you should make sure the list is updated with the data
   from those fields. Go to the Library menu, select Define Term Lists, select the list, and click Update List.

  To unlink a term list from a field:

     1. With the library open, select Link Term Lists from the Library menu.

     2. Scroll through the list of fields to find the field that you would like to be unlinked from a list. Select
        None from the drop-down list next to the field name.

     3. Save your changes by clicking OK.


Deleting and Renaming Term Lists
  Term lists can be renamed without disturbing their links to reference fields or the terms within them. Deleting
  or renaming term lists does not change the data entered into your references.

  To delete or rename a term list:

     1. From the Library menu, select Define Term Lists.

          ▪ To Rename a Term List: Highlight a term list, and then click Rename List. In the Rename List
             dialog, enter the new name for the list, and click OK.

          ▪ To Delete a Term List: Select a term list, and then click Delete List.
     2. Click OK to save your changes.


Configuring Term Separators (Delimiters)
  EndNote uses the delimiters in the Define Lists dialog to determine what punctuation separates the
  individual terms in the same field in a reference.

  For example, if you import data from a source that uses semicolons (;) to separate keywords:

      Adult, Age Factors; Astigmatism; Follow-Up Studies; Hospitals, University;
      Keratotomy, Radial; Myopia; Refraction, Ocular

  you would want to be sure that the semicolon was selected as a separator for your Keywords term list. You
  would also want to be sure that the comma was not chosen because the commas in this example are used
  within some of the terms.

  By default, EndNote uses the semicolon (;), backslash (\), and end-of-line markers as separators. Words or
  phrases entered on different lines in a field (by pressing Enter) are always interpreted as separate terms, but
  the other separators can be changed depending on your needs.

      Page 176 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   Note: Line breaks are the only allowable separators for Author and Journal lists, so the delimiter options
   cannot be changed for lists linked to the following fields: Author, Secondary Author, Tertiary Author,
   Subsidiary Author, Translated Author, Journal/Secondary Title, and Alternate Title.

  To customize the delimiters for a term list:

     1. Open a library.

     2. If you have more than one library open, select a library from the drop-down list at the top of the
        dialog.

     3. From the Library menu, select Define Term Lists. (Each library has its own set of term lists.)

     4. Click on the name of the term list that you intend to modify.

     5. Click the checkbox to the left of the desired separator to select it (or to unselect it if it is already
        checked). The last checkbox provides a place to enter a custom term delimiter, if necessary.

     6. Close the Term Lists dialog to save your changes.


The Journals Term List
  The Journals term list allows EndNote to format bibliographies with the version of journal names required by
  a publisher's style requirements. For example, most humanities styles require the full journal name, while
  scientific and medical journals generally require journal abbreviations, sometimes with periods on
  abbreviated words and sometimes without. Because the Journals term list can track up to four versions of a
  journal name, EndNote styles can use the version of the journal name required by the publisher—but only if
  a Journals term list has been set up with the different variations of the journal names.

  There should be only one multi-column term list per library: the Journals term list. If you somehow
  accidentally delete the Journals term list, it is possible to recreate it, but trying to create multi-column lists for
  other fields, such as publisher or author names, will not work properly in formatting bibliographies.


Important Points About Entering Journal Names
  If you will never need to submit documents that require journal names formatted in different ways, you do
  not have to use the abbreviation sections in a Journals term list. However, if you do need to submit
  documents with different formats for the journal names, keep these points in mind:

      ▪ Enter variations of the same journal name together in one term.

      ▪ Enter a consistent abbreviation format in each column. For example, all abbreviations with periods
          could be entered under the Abbreviation 1, all abbreviations without periods in Abbreviation 2, and
          so on.

      ▪ Only the first term for each journal (the one in the Full Journal slot) is transferred when you insert a
          term into a reference. However, what will show up in the bibliography will depend on the style and
          the consistency of your Journal term list.

      ▪ Use the Journal Abbreviation option in the styles to pick which form of the journal names should be
          used in the bibliography (see Creating Bibliographies with Journal Abbreviations).




      Page 177 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       ▪ EndNote can remove periods from abbreviations during formatting. EndNote cannot add periods to
          an abbreviated journal name.


Loading Supplied Journal Abbreviations
   You can load one of the supplied journal name lists to use for data entry. These lists also contain journal
   abbreviations for alternate output, and are used by certain output styles. The lists are supplied as plain text
   files in the \\EndNote 2025\Terms Lists folder. You can open and view one of these files with any word
   processor, but make sure to leave it a plain text file so that EndNote can import it.

   To replace the existing Journals list with one of the supplied journal abbreviation lists:

      1. From the Library menu, select Open Term Lists, and then select Journals Term List.

      2. Delete all existing terms from the list (you can click and drag to highlight all terms, or use the Ctrl+A
         shortcut, and then click Delete Term. This will give you a "clean slate" to import the journal lists, with
         each version of the name in the correct column of the list.

      3. Click on the Lists tab and select the Journals list.

      4. Click Import List.

      5. In the File dialog, navigate to the \\EndNote 2025\Terms Lists folder, select the list you want to use,
         and click Open to import the journal names and abbreviations from the file into the Journals term list.

      6. Close the Terms Lists dialog.


Updating a Journal List
   For EndNote to accurately use the abbreviated journal names in your bibliographies, it is important to be
   consistent when entering different formats of a journal name. The first column should always list the full
   journal name, and subsequent columns should store consistent formats of abbreviated names. See
   Important Points About Entering Journal Names.

   Journal lists are updated automatically, from the Journal Article and Electronic Article reference types,
   unless you have turned off the preferences to update lists (see Term Lists Preferences). When journal lists
   are updated, the entry in the main Journal field goes into the first column of the list (Full Journal) and the
   journal entered into the Alternate Journal field goes into the second column (Abbreviation 1). Be consistent
   when entering data into these fields so that the Journals term list will be updated correctly. Note that if the
   name entered into the Journal field exists in any of the columns of the Journals term list, it is not added
   again. EndNote tries to avoid duplicate entries in the Journals list.

   If you have turned off the preference to automatically update the term lists, you may manually update the
   lists as described here. When you are manually updating Journal lists, you can choose which columns in the
   list are used for which fields of data.

    Note: It is best to import a terms list, if there is one available in EndNote, before updating from your
    library. This will ensure that a large number of the journal name versions will be in the correct location
    before the update, minimizing cleanup. See Loading Supplied Journal Abbreviations.

   To update a journal term list:

      1. Select a group to update the terms list from, do a search to create the set of references to update
         from, or manually select a set of references to update from.

       Page 178 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      2. From the Library menu, select Define Term Lists… and then select Journals.

      3. Click Update List.

      4. The fields to update the list from should already be selected: the Journal/Secondary Title and
         Alternate Title fields. If you wish to change these fields, select the fields from which EndNote should
         extract the journal names. If importing from selected references, check the Update from Selected
         References option.

      5. Click OK to begin the updating process. When finished, EndNote displays the number of terms
         added to the list. Click OK and the process is complete.

   When the update is complete, you will see a column of journal names listed in alphabetical order.


Creating Bibliographies with Journal Abbreviations
   When you insert a journal name from the Journals term list into a reference, only the first entry for the
   journal name is entered. However, you can create a bibliography that uses any abbreviation in the term list
   by editing the style used to format the paper.

   To edit a style to use journal abbreviations:

      1. From the Tools menu, select Output Styles, then select Open Style Manager.

      2. Select the style that you would like to edit, and click Edit.

      3. From the list of options at the left of the Style Editor window, click Journal Names.

      4. Select one of the available options.

      5. Close and save the style. Now when you format a paper or look at the Preview panel, all of the
         journal names should be replaced with the appropriate abbreviation.

   If a journal name in one of your references does not have the selected abbreviation entered in the Journals
   term list, the journal name appears in the bibliography exactly as it is entered in the Reference window.
   Editing the Journal term list to include all the versions of the name will fix it in the current bibliography and
   any time that journal name is used in the future. See Modifying Terms.

EndNote Web/Online
Overview of EndNote Web/Online
  Starting with EndNote 21, there are two online interfaces for interacting with EndNote references in a
  Synced EndNote library: EndNote online and EndNote Web. Only one EndNote library can be Synced, so
  the same set of references will appear in both online interfaces. This means when you Sync an EndNote
  library, you can access your references through either interface with the same logon credentials if you have
  the current version of EndNote.

  Each EndNote Web/online library can store thousands of records and create bibliographies in thousands of
  publishing styles. Although the references are the same and can be worked with in both interfaces, the
  feature sets available are somewhat different.

  EndNote online is the older online interface for accessing an EndNote library's information online. It has a
  free version with limited storage space and a premium version with unlimited storage space. EndNote Web
  is a newer online interface for accessing the same EndNote library's information online.


EndNote Online
  With EndNote online, our Cite While You Write feature is available to anyone using Microsoft Word on the
  desktop to create bibliographies. (See Cite While You Write in Microsoft Word and The Application Tab in
  the Cite While You Write Preferences Dialog.) If you use the Go to EndNote online command in Cite While
  You Write in Word, it will take you to your EndNote online library.

  EndNote online has a feature set that provides a range of bibliographic management tools on the Web. You
  can import and edit references via a personal EndNote account, and then cite the references in papers and
  create bibliographies.

  EndNote online can search Web of Science, PubMed, and hundreds of other online library databases to
  help you build a personal reference collection. It includes integration with the Web of Science Core
  Collection with dynamic links to Times Cited records and Related Records giving you one-click access to the
  latest information on a reference article.

  EndNote online allows you to create and share groups with other EndNote users, just as you can in
  EndNote. Shared groups can be managed through either the desktop or EndNote online interface.


EndNote Web
  EndNote Web provides an online interface more similar in appearance to the desktop. For example, while in
  EndNote online you must edit reference data in a separate browser window, with EndNote Web you can edit
  a reference in the same window with Summary, Edit, and File Attachment panels, much as you can on the
  desktop. If a reference has a PDF attached, from the File Attachment or Summary panels you can open that
  PDF in a separate browser window with a PDF reader to view it. If CrossRef has updated metadata
  information for a reference, the Edit panel will display an alert.

  The Summary Panel for a reference also provides a preview option for viewing the reference as it would
  appear for a limited number of styles, with the ability to copy the reference in that format for pasting into a
  document.




      Page 180 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


  EndNote Web includes the Research Assistant feature, also available in EndNote desktop. The Research
  Assistant uses a generative AI-powered tool that enhances your research discovery by extracting key
  insights from individual papers, creating a summary of the article independent of the author's abstract. You
  can find more information at Artificial Intelligence (AI) in EndNote: The Research Assistant.

  EndNote Web also includes a PDF viewer for PDF attachments.

  Cite While You Write with Word Online and Google Docs integrates with EndNote Web. Links from those
  applications will take you to the EndNote Web interface for your library.

  EndNote Web supports the Tags feature in EndNote. Tags can be assigned and managed for references
  from either the desktop or the EndNote Web interface.

  Like the desktop interface, EndNote Web allows you to control the columns that show in the browser. Just
  click the Columns button at the far right. Then click a column heading to sort the library by that field.

  EndNote Web allows you to control the interface display through the     with options to match the operating
  system, or to choose a light or dark display.

  And, of course, you can manage your references in multiple ways using the handy EndNote Web toolbar.




           Create new reference

           Add selected references to groups

           Export selected references (in the .ris format)

           Remove selected references from group

           Get citations for selected references

           Move selected reference to trash

   Note: The command to Get citations for selected references does not download cited references. It
   provides a view of how the reference would be formatted according to a limited number of styles, with an
   option to copy the reference as it appears.


Accessing EndNote Web / Online
  To access your EndNote account through the EndNote Online interface, go to https://my.endnote.com, enter
  your login information, and click Sign in.

  To access your EndNote account through the new EndNote Web interface, go to https://web.endnote.com,
  enter your login information, and click Sign in.

Registering for an EndNote Account
Registering with EndNote Web/Online
   Your purchase of EndNote entitles you to a three-year free subscription to EndNote Web/online and the
   option to synchronize the references (including files and figures) in your EndNote library with the references
   in your EndNote Web/online library without having to export and import files.

   You must first register and have an active EndNote account to initiate the Sync process. Registration is fast
   and easy and activates your three-year EndNote account. When completed, EndNote automatically
   proceeds with the Sync process and updates your new EndNote Web/online library to match the references
   and custom groups in your EndNote library.

    Note: The Sync process includes groups, group sets, group associations, and tags. EndNote online can
    only display custom groups; EndNote Web can only display group sets, custom groups, and tags.


Activating the Sync Process

   Since you already have an EndNote account, EndNote populates the fields on the Sync Preferences page
   with the e-mail address and password that you entered on the EndNote Web/online login dialog. You can
   change the data in these fields if you ever change your email address or password in EndNote Web/online.

    Note: The Sync library that you defined in Sync Preferences must be open and currently active to perform
    the Sync process.

       6. Before synchronizing for the first time, you will be prompted to create a compressed library backup.
          Click the Yes button to create the backup.

       7. Choose the location for your backup, then click the Save button.

   EndNote will save the backup and begin synchronizing your library references.

   Once you create your EndNote account, EndNote populates the fields on the Sync Preferences page with
   the email address and password that you entered during registration. Later you can change the data in
   these fields if you ever change your email address or password in EndNote Web/online.

    Note: Although it is possible to synchronize your library without creating a compressed library backup
    during your first synchronization, we suggest creating the backup. You can also create a compressed
    backup of your library at any time. See Saving a Compressed Copy of a Library for more information.


Library Status Dialog
   The Library Status Dialog will give you information about your last Sync, as well as other information about
   your library.


Sync Preferences
   Sync Preferences allow you to set your preferences so that:

       ▪ You only have to enter your e-mail address and password once in Sync Preferences and not each
          time you manually synchronize your references between EndNote and EndNote Web/online.

       ▪ You can have EndNote automatically begin the Sync process every 15 minutes (background
          processing) by selecting the Sync Automatically checkbox.

   To access these settings, go to the Edit menu, select Preferences, and then click Sync in the list of
   preferences. See Sync Preferences.

      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide



Overview of the Sync Process
  EndNote allows you to synchronize your entire desktop library with EndNote Web/online and the iPad app.

  The Sync process automatically synchronizes both sets of references that reside in the desktop and online
  so that the references in your library in EndNote and EndNote Web/online are an exact match.

  The Sync process is always initiated from EndNote. The data in EndNote and EndNote Web/online are
  synchronized in all three applications when you run Sync. You will have identical custom groups and
  references in both EndNote online and EndNote Web when Sync completes processing.

  The Sync process includes all data changes to references (including file attachments) during the Sync
  process so that each library matches the other. For example, if you add or remove references and/or PDF
  files in EndNote, then those changes are updated in EndNote Web/online and vice-versa.

  The Sync process includes updates and additions to groups in all three libraries. For example, if you create
  and add references to a new custom group in EndNote, then you will see this group in EndNote Web/online
  the next time you run the Sync process.

  Although the information about group sets, smart groups, and combination groups is included in the Sync
  process, these groups and group sets are not supported by EndNote online and so are not visible. Group
  sets and custom groups are visible in EndNote Web, as well as tags, but smart groups and combination
  groups are not visible. If you sync your library with another computer, all groups, group sets, and tags will be
  available on the second computer.


Sync Preferences
  Sync Preferences allow you to set your preferences so that:

      ▪ You only have to enter your e-mail address and password once in Sync Preferences and not each
         time you manually synchronize your references between EndNote desktop and EndNote Web/online.

      ▪ You can have EndNote automatically begin the Sync process every 15 minutes (background
         processing) by selecting the Sync Automatically checkbox.

  To access these settings, go to the Edit menu, select Preferences, and then click Sync in the list of
  preferences. See Sync Preferences.


Important Points to Know About the Sync Process

      ▪ Sync synchronizes the references, groups, group sets, and tags in your library; it does not
         synchronize the library as a whole. The important difference is that the record numbers will probably
         not be the same in both copies of the library. This is because the references will be assigned new
         record numbers on the new computer. See Record Numbers.

      ▪ Sync includes an unlimited number of references in your library and an unlimited amount of storage
         for file attachments and figures during the three-year subscription period.

      ▪ Sync works with only one library and only one EndNote Web/online account.

      ▪ Your sync library can be shared with up to 1,000 other EndNote users on version 2025 or later. See
         About Shared Libraries.




      Page 184 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       ▪ Sync your references in EndNote (including groups, group sets, smart groups, combination groups,
          and tags) between one desktop and another desktop on various platforms.

       ▪ After the Sync process completes, EndNote identifies each group that has Sharing enabled in
          EndNote online with a shared group icon. A shared group is a group in which your colleagues can
          access and see your groups in their Groups Shared by Others section.

       ▪ Sync will put groups, when a group set cannot be identified, in an Unfiled Groups set. Drag and drop
          the group to the appropriate group set in the desktop library.

       ▪ You can select any EndNote library that you created with EndNote to synchronize with your EndNote
          Web/online library, but only one library can be synced. If you try to sync your online account to
          another desktop library, the libraries will be merged. See Merging Libraries through Sync.

       ▪ Sync includes references that have been moved to the Trash group. If you have references that were
          moved to Trash in the desktop version, those references will be moved to the Trash group in the
          Web/online version.

       ▪ EndNote automatically prompts you to Sync your EndNote library with your EndNote Web/online
          library when you close your default EndNote library.


Library Status Dialog
   The Library Status dialog allows you to review information about the currently open library. If it is the
   EndNote library that you selected to synchronize with your EndNote Web/online library, it will also provide
   information about that library's Sync status.

   Below are screenshots showing differences in the information available before and after a library's first
   Sync.


Before the First Sync




       Page 185 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   The Library Status dialog here shows the Configure Sync button because it has not been synced. It also
   shows information about the location of the library, the number of references in the library, (relative)
   attachments, absolute attachments, group sets, groups, and tags in the library. (See Selecting a Relative
   Path or an Absolute Path for File Attachments for information on the differences between relative and
   absolute attachments.)


After the First Sync




   The dialog above shows everything the previous screenshot showed, but it also includes information about
   the current Sync status, such as if the Sync was completed and all changes were sent, if there were any
   errors, and what the error message was if there were an error.

   Information available in the Library Status dialog will be automatically updated, but can be refreshed at any
   time by clicking the Refresh Status button.

   Text in the status window can be copied and pasted into a text file using the standard Edit > Copy (Ctrl+C)
   and Edit > Paste (Ctrl+V) commands.

   If there is a conflict during the sync process, a Sync Conflicts temporary group will appear in EndNote.
   See Resolve Sync Conflicts Dialog for information on resolving conflicts and their causes.

    Note: Although the Library Status icon appears in the Groups panel, it is not really a group as defined in
    EndNote.

Sync Details
   Check the information under this heading if processing errors occur during a Sync operation. EndNote
   displays error text and codes in the dialog detailing the problem. For example, you might see an error like
   this if you are not connected to the Internet:

       Error message: EndNote could not connect to the online sync service.

   An authorization error might show:

       Error message: The username/password specified is not valid.

   If you experience problems with EndNote Sync which cannot be worked out from the messages in the Sync
   Details, contact technical support.


Library Details
   This section of the dialog provides information information about the EndNote account the library was
   Synced to and the serial number associated with that EndNote account. This section also shows information
   about the local library, including the library name and location, and the number of group sets, groups, and
   tags.


Sync Limits
   This section shows how many references, groups, and group sets you are allowed in your library, and how
   much attachment storage is available to you. If you are within your free three-year subscription, the
   attachment storage will be unlimited. If your subscription has expired, you will be limited to 2 gigabytes of
   attachment storage.


Resolve Sync Conflicts Dialog
   The Resolve Sync Conflicts dialog allows you to resolve conflicts between references in your EndNote
   library and your EndNote Web/Online library.

   A conflict occurs for a reference when you edit the reference in both EndNote and in EndNote Web/online
   between Syncs. With two different sets of changes, EndNote does not know which one(s) you want to keep.


Sync Conflicts Group
   This group contains all of the references for which EndNote has identified a conflict between an EndNote
   reference and EndNote Web/online reference. The group only appears in the Groups panel when there are
   conflicts.

   To resolve Sync conflicts:

       ▪ Right-click the Sync Conflicts group and select the Resolve Conflicts option from the contextual
          menu. EndNote displays the Resolve Sync Conflicts dialog.

       ▪ Select the Sync Conflicts group to display a list of references that EndNote has identified as having a
          conflict. Select one or more references from the list. Right-click and select the Resolve Conflicts
          option from the contextual menu.



       Page 187 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


Resolving Conflicts
   You can keep either the EndNote desktop reference or the EndNote Web/online reference to resolve a
   conflict. The version of the reference you do not choose to keep is permanently deleted

       ▪ To resolve a conflict between two references, click the Keep Desktop Reference button or the Keep
          Online Reference button. Once you select a record to keep, EndNote updates the record in both
          EndNote desktop and EndNote Web/online.

       ▪ To resolve all conflicts in favor of the desktop version or the Web version, select the Keep All
          Desktop References option or the Keep All Online References option from the drop-down Keep All
          menu at the bottom of the dialog. Once you select either option, EndNote updates the records in
          both EndNote desktop and EndNote Web/online.

   You can also:

       ▪ Copy and paste information between the two records. The record that you keep will include all data
          copied to the record.

       ▪ Skip or Cancel a conflict. All references in conflict remain in the Sync Conflicts auto-group until they
          are resolved.

   Note: When you choose to keep a record, EndNote immediately sends all the data to EndNote Web/
   online. If your connection to EndNote Web/online fails, the process ends and the dialog closes. However,
   any data already sent to EndNote Web/online is processed.


Did You Know...?

       ▪ When you create a new group in EndNote or EndNote Web/online, the new group is added to the
          other library when you run Sync.

       ▪ When you change a group’s name in both libraries, EndNote uses the most recently changed name
          so no conflict occurs when you run Sync.

       ▪ When you delete a group, there is no conflict. EndNote removes the group and moves the
          references to the Unfiled folder.

       ▪ If you delete a group in one application and rename the same group in the other application,
          EndNote deletes the group when you run Sync. Delete overrules Rename.

       ▪ When you move a reference from one group to another group, then a Sync conflict may occur. If you
          move a reference from Group A to Group B in EndNote desktop and in EndNote Web/online you
          move the same reference to Group C, then the next time you run Sync the reference will be in
          conflict.


Unfiled Groups
   If, during the Sync process, EndNote receives a group from EndNote Web/online that does not belong to
   any group set up in EndNote, then the system automatically adds the group to an Unfiled Groups folder.

   You should move all groups from the Unfiled Groups folder to an existing group set in EndNote. If an
   appropriate group set does not currently exist, then you should create one. EndNote removes the Unfiled
   Groups folder from the Groups panel when you move all unfiled groups to a group set.

Web of Science Integration
View Source Records and Related Records
  If your reference contains a Web of Science identification number, you can access the Web of Science
  source record or view a list of related records directly from the library reference. A Web of Science
  subscription is required to access this content.

  In the Reference Summary panel, select the Web of Science article record link or the Web of Science
  related records link. These links will appear even if you do not have a Web of Science subscription, but will
  only work if you have a valid subscription and are authenticated for access to the Web of Science.


Creating Citation Reports
  The Web of Science Citation Report makes it easy to explore the publication trends and citation
  performance for a set of research. If you have access to both EndNote and Web of Science, you can create
  a Web of Science Citation Report starting from a group of references in EndNote 2025.

  The Citation Report provides aggregate citation statistics for a set of search results. These statistics include:

      ▪ The total number of results found (Results Found field).

      ▪ The total number of times all records have been cited (Sum of Times Cited field).

      ▪ The total number of citations to all results found in the results set minus any citation from articles in
         the set (Sum of Times Cited without Self-Citations field).

      ▪ The total number of citations to any of the items in the set of search results (Citing Articles field).

      ▪ The citing articles minus any article that appears in the set of search results (Citing Articles without
         Self-citations field).

      ▪ The average number of times a record has been cited (Average Citations per Item field).

      ▪ The total number of times a record has been cited for all years in the results set (Total column).

      ▪ The h-index count that is based on the list of publications ranked in descending order by the Times
         Cited count.

  To create a Citation Report, in the Groups menu, right-click on a group and select Create Citation Report.

   Note: At least one reference in the group must contain either a Web of Science identification number or a
   PubMed identification number (PMID) for the Citation Report to be generated.

  You must have access to the Web of Science to use this feature. If you do not have access to the Web of
  Science, contact your institution about signing in and registering for an account.

Working with Documents
 This section covers creating documents with references from EndNote.

 Cite While You Write (CWYW) allows you to create formatted citations and bibliographies within popular
 word processors, such as Microsoft Word, Word Online, Google Docs, LibreOffice 4.x–7.x (32-bit) for
 Windows, and Apache OpenOffice Writer 3.x or 4.x.

 Format Paper allows you to create formatted citations and bibliographies in word processors that create
 documents in the Rich Text Format (RTF).

 You can also create independent bibliographies, including subject bibliographies, with EndNote.

  Note: Some writing applications, especially those for working with large documents, provide an option to
  save a copy of the final document in Rich Text Format (RTF) or in the Microsoft Word format. This allows
  two options for formatting the citations and bibliography.

  If you do not have access to Word, use the instructions found in the Format Paper section to insert
  temporary citations and save the document in Rich Text Format (RTF), then scan the document and
  create a copy with formatted citations and a bibliography. See the Basic Instructions for Using Format
  Paper, Components of a Temporary Citation, and Notes About Temporary Citations sections for more
  information on adding temporary citations in applications that do not support Cite While You Write.

  If you have access to Microsoft Word, you can save a copy of the final output to the Microsoft
  Word .DOCX format, open that document in Word, and use Cite While You Write in that document to
  create formatted citations and a bibliography. See Basic Instructions for Using Format
  Paper, Components of a Temporary Citation, and Notes About Temporary Citations sections for more
  information on adding temporary citations in applications that do not support Cite While You Write.
  See Configuring the Bibliography in Word for information on formatting the copy of the document saved
  in .DOCX format in Word.

Cite While You Write in Microsoft Word
Overview of the Cite While You Write Process in Word
  Use Cite While You Write (CWYW) with Microsoft Word 2010, 2013, 2016, 2019, 2021, or Office 365 to
  easily and quickly cite references, figures, and tables, and create a paper with properly formatted citations, a
  bibliography, figures, and tables.

  Cite While You Write gives you access to EndNote references and formatting commands through an
  EndNote tab in Word.

  You can start by inserting a citation into a document. A bibliography formatted according to any one of
  thousands of styles is created. Instant formatting technology can automatically update your citations and
  bibliography as you write. You can even insert figures and tables found in EndNote references.

  A Traveling Library allows you to reformat references in your Word document even when your EndNote
  library is not available. If you are collaborating with other authors, you can rely on the Traveling Library to
  supply reference information.

  You can use your EndNote desktop application or EndNote online to Cite While You Write in Microsoft Word.
  See Using Cite While You Write with EndNote Online.


How to Cite While You Write with Microsoft Word
  The basic steps required to cite a reference and generate a bibliography with Microsoft Word are
  summarized below.

  To Cite While You Write:

     1. Open the EndNote library or libraries that contain the references you wish to cite.

     2. Start Microsoft Word and open the paper you are writing.

     3. When you are ready to cite a source, position the cursor in the text where you would like to put the
        citation.

     4. On the EndNote 2025 tab, click the Insert Citation button. A Find & Insert My References dialog
        appears. (If you click on the drop-down list arrow at the bottom of this button, you will be given
        choices beyond finding and inserting citations.)

     5. In the text box at the top, enter identifying text for EndNote to locate the appropriate reference. This
        could be an author’s last name, a year, a keyword, or any other combination of terms found in the
        reference.

     6. Click Find and EndNote compares the identifying text to your EndNote references and then lists the
        matching reference(s).

     7. Identify and highlight the appropriate reference(s).

     8. Use the Insert button drop-down to display a menu, and select from:



      Page 193 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


          ▪ Insert: To insert the citation and format it as defined by the currently selected output style. (This
             would be the same result as simply clicking on the Insert button.)

          ▪ Display as: Author (Year): Select this menu option to display both the author name and the year
             in the highlighted citation, but with the author name appearing to be outside the citation marker.

          ▪ Exclude Author: Select this to omit the author name from the formatted citation.

          ▪ Exclude Year: Select this to omit the date from the formatted citation.

          ▪ Exclude Author & Year: Select this to omit both the author name and the year from an Author-
             Date formatted citation. This is usually used when you want only page numbers to appear in the
             citation.

          ▪ Show Only in Bibliography: Select this option to display the selected citation only in the
             bibliography, not in the body of the paper.

     9. Go back to step 3 to insert the next citation, and continue citing references this way.

     Note: When Instant Formatting is turned on, each time you insert a citation it is formatted and a
     bibliography is updated at the end of your document. When you are done inserting citations, your
     document is done! Instant Formatting is turned on by default. See Instant Formatting in Microsoft
     Word for more information.

    10. If your citations are not automatically formatted, and a bibliography is not updated each time you
        insert a citation, click the Update Citations and Bibliography button on the EndNote 2025 tab.

    11. If you want your paper formatted with a different style, select the style you want from the drop-down
        Style menu. If you do not see the style you want on the list of favorites, click Select another style to
        see the list of all styles installed on your computer. See Installing Additional Output Styles for
        information on installing more styles.

  Your paper is ready for publication!

  If you want to insert figure or table citations, see Inserting and Formatting Figures and Tables.


Word Processor Compatibility
  To Cite While You Write in Microsoft Word, you must use Microsoft Word 2010, 2013, 2016, 2019, 2021, or
  Office 365.

  Install the latest service pack from Microsoft. Cite While You Write can convert and use Word documents
  that used earlier versions of Cite While You Write.

  Word displays Cite While You Write commands on an EndNote 2025 tab.

  If you use WPS Office®, Cite While You Write works much like it does in Microsoft Word on the desktop.

  If you use Apache OpenOffice Writer or LibreOffice 4.x-6.x (32-bit) as your word processor, see How to Cite
  While You Write with OpenOffice Writer.

  If you use a word processor other than those listed above, or an older version of these word processors,
  save your document as an RTF file and use Format Paper.

Finding, Editing, and Deleting References in a Library
Finding Cited References in a Library
   You can quickly jump from a bibliographic in-text citation (not a figure citation) to the corresponding EndNote
   reference.

   To find an EndNote reference:

      1. Make sure both your Word document and your EndNote library are open.

      2. Highlight the citation(s) in your Word document.



       Page 196 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      3. On the EndNote tab, select Edit Library Reference(s).

   EndNote goes to the corresponding reference for editing.


Editing a Reference in the Library
   You may insert a citation in a Word document, and then later edit the corresponding reference in EndNote.
   Are those changes reflected in your Word document?

   Your citations and bibliography will reflect the edits the next time the citations in the paper are updated with
   the EndNote library open. Open your document, open your EndNote library, and click Update Citations and
   Bibliography on the EndNote 2025 tab.

   EndNote will not be able to make the update if the library is not open during formatting. Instead, it will take
   the original reference information from Word’s Traveling Library (see The Traveling Library).

    Note: The author’s last name and the publication year are both used to identify a reference, so changes
    to these items in an EndNote reference are not reflected in the in-text citation. Cite While You Write will no
    longer identify a match between the citation and the reference if the citation is unformatted. If the citation
    is formatted, it will use reference information from Word’s field codes to update the citation and
    bibliography (The Traveling Library).

   If you make changes to a figure in an EndNote reference, you must manually replace the figure in your Word
   document.


Deleting a Reference from the Library
   The first time a citation is formatted, EndNote uses information from the unformatted citation to look in the
   open library and find the corresponding reference. If you later reformat, EndNote again looks in the library
   for that reference. If the reference has been deleted from the library, EndNote takes the reference
   information from hidden Field Codes in Microsoft Word (The Traveling Library).

   So, if you deleted a cited reference from the library, the required information is still available in the hidden
   field codes surrounding each formatted citation—even though the reference is no longer in the library.

   However, an unformatted citation is a temporary placeholder. If a citation is unformatted, and you have
   deleted the corresponding reference from the EndNote library, EndNote will not be able to find the reference
   information for formatting.

   If you add the reference to the library again, it will be assigned a different record number. You would need to
   reinsert the citation in Word.

Record Numbers

   EndNote assigns a unique record number to each reference as it is added to your library. These record
   numbers appear in temporary citations to ensure that the correct reference is used when the paper is

       {Argus, 1991 #11}

   The record number for a reference is also visible in the title bar of the Reference panel.

   Note that:

       ▪ EndNote automatically assigns a record number sequentially to each reference as it is added to a
          library.

       ▪ If the same reference appears in two different libraries, the record numbers will most likely be
          different.

       ▪ Record numbers are never reused or reassigned within a library. When you delete a reference, the
          corresponding record number is never used again in that library.

       ▪ You cannot modify or reassign record numbers.

       ▪ We recommend that you not rely on EndNote’s record numbers as a means of filing or numbering
          your office reprints, because you have no control over this number. Instead, enter your own unique
          number into the Label field, and use that number for your reprints.

   If you add the reference to the library again, it will be assigned a new, different record number, so EndNote
   still will not be able to find a match to your unformatted citation when formatting your paper. You will need to
   reinsert the citation into the paper using the new reference in your library.


Cite While You Write Commands and Field Codes

Cite While You Write Commands
   When Cite While You Write is installed, several EndNote commands appear on an EndNote 2025 tab in
   Word. When you select an EndNote command from the tab, the EndNote program starts (if not already
   running) and a Cite While You Write submenu becomes active on EndNote’s Tools menu, displaying some
   of the same EndNote commands available in Word.

    Note: When you use Cite While You Write Preferences to select EndNote online as the active Cite While
    You Write Application, an EndNote 2025 tab appears in Word. The EndNote online tab displays a smaller
    set of CWYW commands than the EndNote desktop application.

   Below are brief descriptions of the Cite While You Write commands that are found from the EndNote 2025
   tab.

Citations Group

       ▪ Insert Citation > Insert Citation: Search for EndNote references to select and insert as citations in
          your Word document. See Finding and Inserting Citations in Microsoft Word.

       ▪ Insert Citation > Insert Selected Citation(s): Insert a citation for each reference currently selected
          in the open EndNote library. You can insert up to 250 references in a single in-text citation.
          See Inserting Selected Citations in Microsoft Word.

       ▪ Insert Citation > Insert Note: Add custom text citations to your Word document. See Including
          Notes in the List of References in Microsoft Word.

       ▪ Insert Citation > Insert Figure: Search for an EndNote reference that contains a figure, and insert a
          figure or table in your Word document. The figure or table is numbered, and automatically added to



       Page 198 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


         the document. Figures inserted in the document will not appear in the bibliography. See Finding and
         Inserting Figures and Tables.

      ▪ Go To EndNote: Bring EndNote to the front of your screen. This command launches EndNote if it is
         not already running.

      ▪ Edit & Manage Citation(s): Edit existing individual or multiple citations. You can omit author and/or
         year from citations, add prefix or suffix text (such as page numbers) to citations, or delete formatted
         citations from the paper. See Editing Citations in Microsoft Word.

      ▪ Edit Library Reference(s): Select citations in your Word document, then select this command to
         directly edit the corresponding references in EndNote.

Bibliography Group

      ▪ Style: Select an output style from the list to format (or reformat) your paper according to the rules of
         the selected style. The styles listed are marked as "favorites" in the EndNote style manager.

      ▪ Update Citations and Bibliography: Format (or reformat) your paper according to the rules of the
         selected style. The formatting process replaces the temporary citations in your paper with formatted
         citations, and builds a bibliography at the end of the document. This command also updates the
         formatted figures and tables found within the body of the document or in a list at the end of the
         document.

      ▪ Convert Citations and Bibliography > Convert to Unformatted Citations: Unformat a selected
         citation before editing it or unformat the whole document. This removes style formatting for the
         selected citations, and leaves temporary citations, which usually consist of the author’s last name,
         the year, and the record number surrounded by delimiters. Use Update Citations and Bibliography to
         format the paper again. See Unformatting Citations in Microsoft Word.

      ▪ Convert Citations and Bibliography > Convert to Plain Text: Save a copy of your document
         without formatted Cite While You Write field codes. Formatted citations and the bibliography are
         saved as text. See Field Codes in Microsoft Word and Removing Field Codes.

      ▪ Convert Citations and Bibliography > Convert Reference Manager Citations to EndNote:
         Convert any Reference Manager citations in this document to EndNote Cite While You Write
         citations. This option assumes that you have converted your Reference Manager database to an
         EndNote library. Values include Author Date RefID and RefID. For information on converting a
         Reference Manager database, see Converting a Reference Manager Database to EndNote.

      ▪ Convert Citations and Bibliography > Convert Word Citations to EndNote: Convert any citations
         created by Microsoft Word in the document to EndNote Cite While You Write citations.

      ▪ Categorize References: This feature allows you to create a bibliography organized by categories
         you create. See Reference Type Categories in Output Styles.

      ▪ Instant Formatting: Turn instant formatting on or off for the document, set how frequently EndNote
         scans for temporary citations, and whether EndNote checks for citation changes.

      ▪ Configure Bibliography: Click the arrow in the bottom right corner of the Bibliography section to
         display a tabbed dialog of formatting options. When you click OK to leave the dialog, EndNote
         formats (or reformats) your paper according to the rules of the selected style. See Configuring the
         Bibliography in Microsoft Word.




      Page 199 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


    Note: By default, Instant Formatting is turned on, so your citations and bibliography are automatically
    formatted as you work.


Tools Group

       ▪ Export to EndNote > Export Traveling Library: Create an EndNote library from the references
          used in your paper. See Exporting Word’s Traveling Library to an EndNote Library.

       ▪ Export to EndNote > Export Word Citations: Create an EndNote library from citations created by
          Word in the document.

       ▪ Export to EndNote > Export Word Master List: Create an EndNote library from the master list of
          citations created by Word.

       ▪ Preferences: Change general Cite While You Write preferences, change the EndNote keyboard
          shortcuts available in Word, change figure and table settings, or switch to EndNote online Cite While
          You Write. See Setting Cite While You Write Preferences in Microsoft Word.

       ▪ EndNote Help: Display help about Cite While You Write features.
   You may prefer to execute these commands from the keyboard. Note the keyboard shortcuts defined under
   Cite While You Write Preferences.

    Note: Several Cite While You Write commands also appear on the Tools menu in EndNote. To use these
    commands from within EndNote, you must use at least one Cite While You Write command from within
    Word during the current session.


Field Codes in Microsoft Word
   Cite While You Write places field codes around and inside your formatted citations in Word. These hidden
   codes allow EndNote to format, unformat, and reformat citations within Word.

   For example, this formatted citation:

       (Pepperberg, 2009, p. 32)
   contains these field codes:




       Page 200 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide




    Note: We recommend that you not view field codes in Word. If you choose to view field codes, do not
    modify them. Always keep backups of your papers! To automatically turn off the display of field codes
    when you open a Word document, see General Preferences in Microsoft Word.

   Field codes for formatted citations include a Traveling Library of the EndNote references cited. The
   reference data saved with each citation includes all fields except Notes, Research Notes, Abstract, Figure,
   and Caption. This allows you to use the document on a computer that does not contain a copy of your
   EndNote library. See The Traveling Library.

   EndNote’s Cite While You Write field codes are supported by all the versions of Word compatible with
   EndNote 2025. See Word Processor Compatibility for information on if your version of Word is supported.

   Once you start using Cite While You Write, you must take precautions before opening those files in other
   word processors or another version of Word. If a formatted document is opened and saved with an
   incompatible word processor, the formatted EndNote citations and bibliography lose their field codes. When
   this happens, EndNote cannot reformat the document.

   Before you open a paper in a different word processor, or give a publisher an electronic copy of your final
   formatted document, see Sharing Your Word Documents.


Installing Cite While You Write Support in Word
   EndNote’s installation program installs Cite While You Write support for Microsoft Word 2010, 2013, 2016,
   2019, 2021, or Office 365 (locally installed desktop version only).

   If you install Word after installing EndNote, you must manually install Cite While You Write. See No
   EndNote Commands in Word or Writer.

   In Word, EndNote commands appear on an EndNote 2025 tab.

Citing Sources as You Write in Word
   See the sections below for details on citing sources as you write in Word:

       ▪ Inserting Selected Citations into Word

       ▪ Finding and Inserting from Highlighted Text in Word

Forms of Citations in Microsoft Word

   A "citation" is the brief bibliographic information in the body of a paper that refers the reader to a complete
   reference in the bibliography. A citation typically consists of a bibliography number or the author and year in
   parentheses:

           ... of the species at hand1.
           ... of the species at hand (Argus, 1991).

   Citations can appear as either unformatted or formatted in your Word document.

Unformatted (Temporary) Citations

   An unformatted citation is a temporary placeholder, and does not reflect final output. It may appear after you
   insert selected citations.

    Note: If you have Instant Formatting turned on, you may never see an unformatted citation. Instant
    Formatting is turned on by default. See Instant Formatting in Microsoft Word.

   An unformatted citation typically consists of the first author’s last name, the year, and the EndNote record
   number, with citation delimiters at each end to identify the text:

           {Author, Year #Record Number}.

   For example:

             {Alvarez, 1994 #8}

       Page 202 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   EndNote relies on these temporary citations to determine which references to include in the bibliography.

Formatted Citations

   The Configure Bibliography or Update Citations and Bibliography commands use an output style to convert
   all unformatted citations into formatted citations, and reflects final output.

    Note: When Instant Formatting is turned on, formatting is done as you insert citations—but you can still
    change the style or layout of your citations and bibliography.

   Formatted citations include hidden Word field codes in case you want to reformat the bibliography again
   later, even if the original library is not open.

   Citations formatted in an Author-Date style might look like this:

           (Alvarez 1994; Turnhouse 1987)

   This is the same citation formatted in the Numbered style:

           [1,2]

   You can easily revert from formatted citations back to unformatted citations at any time. See Unformatting
   Citations in Microsoft Word.


Finding and Inserting Citations in Microsoft Word
   You can search for EndNote references and insert them without ever leaving Word.

   This is the easiest way to find and insert a citation into a Word document:

      1. Open the EndNote libraries that contain the references you wish to cite.

      2. Open the Word document and position the cursor at the location where you would like the citation.

      3. On the EndNote 2025 tab, click the Insert Citation button, or select the Insert Citation drop-down and
         then Insert Citation.

      4. In the text box at the top, enter text to identify the reference you wish to cite. EndNote assumes an
         "and" between each word, and will search all fields in all the references in your open EndNote library.

      5. Press Enter or click Find and EndNote compares the text to text in your EndNote references and lists
         the matching reference(s). If no references match your text, you need to modify your search text and
         search again.

      6. Identify and highlight the appropriate reference(s).

      7. Use the Insert button drop-down to display a menu, and select from:

           ▪ Insert: To insert the citation and format it as defined by the currently selected output style. (This
              would be the same result as simply clicking on the Insert button.)

           ▪ Display as: Author (Year): Select this menu option to display both the author name and the year
              in the highlighted citation, but with the author name appearing to be outside the citation marker.



       Page 203 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


           ▪ Exclude Author: Select this to omit the author name from the formatted citation.

           ▪ Exclude Year: Select this to omit the date from the formatted citation.

           ▪ Exclude Author & Year: Select this to omit both the author name and the year from an Author-
              Date formatted citation. This is usually used when you want only page numbers to appear in the
              citation.

           ▪ Show Only in Bibliography: Select this option to display the selected citation only in the
              bibliography, not in the body of the paper.

            Note: You can click the Insert button (not select the drop-down) to quickly select the default Insert
            command.

   Citations are inserted directly into your paper in the same font as the surrounding text, using the Normal
   style font. Once a citation is inserted and formatted, it contains complete reference information in hidden
   codes.

   You can insert citations in an existing manuscript or as you write. Remember to save your document as you
   work.

   To format your citations and generate a bibliography, see Configuring the Bibliography in Microsoft Word. In
   most cases, Instant Formatting applies as you insert citations (see Instant Formatting in Microsoft Word).


Inserting Selected Citations in Microsoft Word
   To insert references selected in EndNote:

      1. Open the Word document and position the cursor at the location where you would like the citation.

      2. On the EndNote 2025 tab, select Go to EndNote.

      3. Highlight the desired reference(s) in your EndNote library.

      4. From the Tools menu in EndNote, select the Cite While You Write submenu and select Insert
         Selected Citation(s), or click the Insert Selected Citations button ( ), or on the EndNote 2025 tab in
         Word, select the Insert Citation drop-down, and then Insert Selected Citation(s).


Finding and Inserting from Highlighted Text in Microsoft Word
   To find and insert a citation from highlighted text:

      1. As you are typing, enter text to identify the reference you wish to cite, and select that text.

      2. On the EndNote 2025 tab, click the Insert Citation button. EndNote will automatically enter the
         selected text into the search field of the Find & Insert My References dialog and bring up a list of
         matching references from your open library.

      3. Identify and highlight the appropriate reference(s).

      4. Use the Insert button drop-down to display a menu, and select from:

            ▪ Insert: To insert the citation and format it as defined by the currently selected output style. (This
               would be the same result as simply clicking on the Insert button.)

       Page 204 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


           ▪ Display as: Author (Year): Select this menu option to display both the author name and the
               year in the highlighted citation, but with the author name appearing to be outside the citation
               marker.

           ▪ Exclude Author: Select this to omit the author name from the formatted citation.

           ▪ Exclude Year: Select this to omit the date from the formatted citation.

           ▪ Exclude Author & Year: Select this to omit both the author name and the year from an Author-
               Date formatted citation. This is usually used when you want only page numbers to appear in the
               citation.

           ▪ Show Only in Bibliography: Select this option to display the selected citation only in the
               bibliography, not in the body of the paper.

            Note: You can click the Insert button (not select the drop-down) to quickly select the default Insert
            command.


Using Drag-and-Drop or Copy and Paste in Microsoft Word
   You can drag selected citations from your EndNote library and drop them into your paper at the desired
   location for the citation.

   You can also copy citations from the EndNote Library and paste them into the document using
   Copy (Ctrl+C) from EndNote’s Edit menu and then Paste (Ctrl+V) from Word’s clipboard.


Inserting Multiple Citations in Microsoft Word
   There are several ways to insert multiple references in one in-text citation. When formatted, they appear as
   one multiple citation, sorted as your bibliographic style requires:

       Unformatted: {Hall, 1988 #77; Baker, 1988 #16}
       Formatted: (Baker, 1988; Hall, 1988)

   You can insert up to 250 references in a single in-text citation, although the limit could be lower depending
   upon limitations on the amount of data a Word field code can contain.

    Note: If one of the citations in a multiple citation is not matched during formatting, the entire citation
    remains unformatted. Notes cannot be inserted as part of a multiple citation.

   To insert multiple citations from Word:

      1. On the EndNote 2025 tab, click the Insert Citation button.

      2. Enter a search term that will find the references you want, and press Enter or click Find.

      3. Hold down the Ctrl key while clicking on the desired references in the list (or hold down the Shift key
         to select a continuous range of references) in order to highlight the references.

      4. Click the Insert button.

   To insert multiple selected citations from EndNote:



       Page 205 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      1. In EndNote, hold down the Ctrl key while clicking on the desired references in your library (or hold
         down the Shift key to select a continuous range of references).

      2. From the Tools menu in EndNote, select the Cite While You Write submenu and select Insert
         Selected Citation(s), or click the Insert Selected Citations button ( ).

   To insert multiple citations individually:

   Another option is to insert citations individually, but immediately next to each other. Cite While You Write
   merges adjacent citations during formatting. Citations do not merge if any character separates them–
   including a space or punctuation mark.

       Unformatted: {Hall, 1988 #77}{Baker, 1988 #16}
       Formatted: (Baker, 1988; Hall, 1988)

    Note: You can add citations to an existing in-text citation or change the order of citations within the
    delimiters with the Edit Citations dialog. See Editing Citations in Microsoft Word.

   To insert, remove, or edit citations within an existing in-text citation:

      1. Click on the formatted citation.

      2. On the EndNote tab, click Edit & Manage Citation(s). All of the cited references in the document are
         listed, with the reference you clicked selected. Each citation will show how it is formatted above the
         references for that citation, as a subheading within the list. Click on the Reference tab below the list
         to see details for the reference.

      3. Highlight a citation, and then select an option from the drop-down menu at the right:

           ▪ Click Remove Citation to delete it.

           ▪ Click Insert Citation to add another reference within the same citation.

           ▪ Use the arrow buttons at the left to change the order of the citation in a multiple citation. (If a
              Citation Sort Order is applied by the current output style, changing the order of citations in a
              multiple citation has no effect.)

   You can use the other features on this dialog as described in Customizing Individual Citations.


Inserting from Multiple Libraries in Microsoft Word
   You can cite references from multiple libraries. Simply open the selected libraries before you begin inserting
   citations.

   If possible, though, we recommend that you use a single library when writing a paper. Keeping all of your
   references in one library simplifies the writing process because you know exactly where to find each
   reference, there is little likelihood of duplicate references, and you only need to have one library open when
   inserting citations.

    Note: If you plan to insert citations from more than one library into a paper, read about the Merge
    Duplicates in Bibliography preference




       Page 206 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


Inserting Quotations from PDFs
   You can insert quotations from PDFs attached to your EndNote references directly into your Word
   documents, with the citation to match the quotation automatically inserted following the quotation.

       1. Open the Word document you want to insert the citation in.

       2. Position the cursor where the quotation and citation are to be inserted.

       3. Click the Go to EndNote button on the EndNote CWYW toolbar to go to EndNote.

       4. In EndNote, go to the reference you want to cite, then go the PDF subpanel in the Reference panel.

       5. Click the Open the reference in a new window ( ) button. This will open the PDF in the PDF viewer
          to enable selecting text from the PDF more easily.

       6. Select the text you want to cite in the PDF, then click the Quote and Cite (   ) button.

   The selected text will be immediately inserted in the document inside double quotation marks ("), with the
   citation immediately following and formatted according to the style being used. You may replace the double
   quotation marks with other characters, such as guillemets («») or single quotation marks, to match the style
   requirements for your document.



Customizing Individual Citations
   There may be cases where you want individual citations to differ from the standard format. You may want to
   remove the year or author from a citation if either was mentioned in the context of the sentence. Or, you
   might want to add a page reference or comment before or after the citation.

   For example, assume a formatted citation looks like this:

       Hall’s discovery (Hall, 1988)

   You can omit the author’s name from the citation:

       Hall’s discovery (1988)

   You can omit the date from the citation:

       the 1988 discovery (Hall)

   You can add a suffix with page number(s) to the citation:

       the discovery (Hall, 1988 p.4)

   You can add a prefix to the citation:

       the discovery (see Hall, 1988)

   To customize a formatted citation:

      1. Insert and format the citation.

      2. Click on the formatted citation.


       Page 207 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      3. On the EndNote 2025 tab, click Edit & Manage Citation(s). All of the cited references in the
         document are listed, with the citation you clicked on selected. Each citation will show how it is
         formatted above the reference(s) for that citation, as a subheading within the list. Click on the
         Reference tab below the list to see details for the reference. Click on the Edit Citation tab below the
         list to edit the reference.

      4. Select the citation you want to customize.

      5. To change the format of the citation, select one of these options from the drop-down Format menu:

           ▪ Default Format: Select this menu option to display the citation and format it as defined by the
              currently selected output style.

           ▪ Display as: Author (Year): Select this menu option to display both the author name and the year
              in the highlighted citation, but with the author name appearing to be outside the citation marker.

           ▪ Exclude Author: Select this to omit the author name from the formatted citation.

           ▪ Exclude Year: Select this to omit the date from the formatted citation.

           ▪ Exclude Author & Year: Select this to omit both the author name and the year from an Author-
              Date formatted citation. This is usually used when you want only page numbers to appear in the
              citation.

           ▪ Show Only in Bibliography: Select this option to display the selected citation only in the
              bibliography, not in the body of the paper.

      6. To add additional text to the citation, use the options below:

           ▪ Prefix: Enter text here to print immediately before the citation text (include spaces).

           ▪ Suffix: Enter text here to print after the citation text (spaces and punctuation should be included).
              You can enter page numbers here if you always want them to print after the citation in a custom
              format, even if the style doesn't normally include them.

           ▪ Pages: Page numbers entered here are considered entered into a "Cited Pages" field, so they
              can be manipulated by the style, just like any other EndNote field. In order to print, the Cited
              Pages field must be listed in the citation template and/or footnote template of your output style.
              This is typically used to print the page numbers within a full footnote citation. Most EndNote styles
              that require a special format for citations in footnotes are already configured this way. You can
              modify the Citation Template in your output style to include the Cited Pages field.

      7. Click OK to implement the change(s) to the citation.


Including Notes in the List of References in Microsoft Word
   Some journal styles require that you include notes along with the list of works cited at the end of the
   document. In such a system, notes are numbered just like citations, and are included in the reference list in
   order of appearance, along with bibliographic references.

   Including notes in this way makes sense only when you are formatting your paper with a numbered style
   (not an author-date style). Therefore, this feature works only with numbered in-text styles.

   To insert text as a numbered note in the reference list:



       Page 208 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      1. Position the cursor at the location in your text where you would like the number indicating the note.

      2. On the EndNote 2025 tab, select Insert Note from the Insert Citation drop-down menu.

      3. Type your note text into the text box. There is no limit on the amount of text you can enter.

      4. Click OK to insert the numbered note.

   When your paper is formatted by EndNote using a numbered style, the note text is assigned a number and
   listed along with the references at the end of the paper.

   The way that notes are displayed when unformatted can be changed in the Temporary Citations
   Preferences.

   To manually type text as a numbered note in the reference list:

      1. Type the text into the body of your document where you would want the number for the note to
         appear.

      2. Be sure to surround the entire section of text with your Temporary Citation delimiters (curly braces by
         default), and begin it with "NOTE:" followed by a space and your note text. For example:

          {NOTE: The authors would like to acknowledge the support of...}

Restrictions on the Use of the "NOTE" Feature:

       ▪ This feature requires that a numbered style be used for formatting; otherwise, the note appears as
          text in the body of your paper.

       ▪ Enter alphanumeric text only. Do not enter graphics, equations, or symbols.

       ▪ Do not use the temporary citation delimiters as part of the text of the note. Other markers, such as
          the record number marker, the prefix marker, and the multiple citation separator may be used.

       ▪ Notes cannot be combined with regular bibliographic citations within the same set of delimiters (such
          as parentheses or brackets). They must be cited separately—each in its own set of delimiters.


Inserting Citations into a Formatted Paper in Microsoft Word
   To add a new reference to an existing citation, insert the new reference next to (not within) the existing
   citation, with no spaces or punctuation between them, like this:

       (Hockney and Ellis, 1996){Argus, 1984 #1}

   Adjacent citations are merged during formatting, and the formatted citations are sorted according to the
   style:

       (Argus, 1984; Hockney and Ellis, 1996)

    Note: Do not insert a citation into the middle of a formatted citation. Insert it immediately before or after
    the existing citation, with no space between them.

Citing References in Footnotes and Endnotes
  Once you have created a footnote or endnote in Microsoft Word, you can cite references in that footnote or
  endnote just like you cite them in the body of the document.

  To cite a reference in a footnote or endnote:

     1. Use the appropriate command in Word to create the footnote or endnote. (EndNote does not create
        the footnote or endnote in the document, but is used to insert and format citations in the note.)

     2. Position the cursor in the footnote or endnote where you would like the citation to appear.

     3. Insert the citation as you normally would.

   Note: You can edit a full reference footnote citation to exclude author name, year, or author/year. Note
   that the Author(Year) option does not apply to full-reference footnotes.

  The selected EndNote style determines how citations in footnotes and endnotes are formatted. EndNote can
  format these citations as brief in-text citations or like complete references in the bibliography. It can also
  create a special format specific to footnotes or endnotes, including options like "Ibid." and other variations of
  shortened references when a citation appears more than once in the footnotes or endnotes. See
  Bibliography and Footnote Templates.

  If you are citing full references in footnotes, you can include specific page numbers to be formatted like a
  regular EndNote field. See Customizing Individual Citations. Or, if you are manually typing citations, see
  Citing Specific Page Numbers in Footnotes.


Typing Citations into Your Paper
  There are many ways to insert citations in your paper. One way is to manually type temporary citations
  directly into your paper.

  The rules described in the following topics govern how EndNote recognizes and interprets temporary
  (unformatted) citations. Use these rules when typing temporary citations directly into your document.

   Note: For new documents or documents that have never been formatted, when Instant Formatting is
   enabled, it is not triggered when you manually type a reference into a document. You must use the
   EndNote 2025 tab in Word to either insert another citation or format the citations and a reference list. If a
   document has been successfully formatted, and you manually type in a temporary citation, that citation
   will be instantly formatted.

Notes About Temporary Citations

      ▪ Each citation must match only one reference in the library.

      ▪ When Instant Formatting is turned off, a temporary citation is enclosed in citation delimiters and
         typically includes the first author’s last name, the year of publication, and the record number for that
         reference. For example:

              {Schwartz,1990 #5;Billoski,1992 #28}.

         If you would prefer to use the Label field or Accession Number field instead of the record number in
         temporary citations, see Temporary Citations Preferences for information on this setting.

      ▪ Within one set of citation delimiters you can have several citations separated by semicolons.

      ▪ Curly braces ("{" and "}") are the default temporary citation delimiters, although they can be changed
         (see Temporary Citation Delimiters). EndNote looks for these markers to find citations in your word
         processing documents.

      ▪ In addition to the citation delimiters, there are other possible components to a temporary citation:
         Author, Year, Record Number, Prefix Text, Suffix Text, and any other text found in the record. You
         can also use a special tag to format the citation as Author (Year). See Components of a Temporary
         Citation.

      ▪ Any part of a temporary citation can be omitted, as long as enough information remains to match just
         one reference in the library. If you omit an author or year from a temporary citation, those
         components are omitted from the formatted citation as well—although you can change this
         preference. See Omitting Authors or Years from Citations for more information. Additionally, you can
         omit the entire citation so that the entry only appears in the bibliography (see Components of a
         Temporary Citation).


Components of a Temporary Citation
  The typical EndNote temporary (unformatted) citation consists of an author’s last name, a year, and a record
  number, all enclosed in citation delimiters. However, temporary citations can take on various other formats.

  Temporary citations must begin and end with the opening and closing citation delimiters, but the other
  components of a temporary citation can vary.

  You can type any string of text found in the reference, as in:

      {dinosaur extinction}

  Or, you can type any of these items in this order (comma placement is significant):

      {Prefix \Author, Year #Record Number Suffix}
      {Prefix \Author, Year, Any Text, Suffix}

  Each component is briefly described below; more detailed information follows.


      Page 211 of 631
    Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


Author’s Last Name: Only the last name of one author is listed in a temporary citation. It can be any author
associated with the reference, not just the first author. Include a comma after the author’s name to limit the
search only to author fields:

    {Schwartz, 1990}

Year: The year should appear exactly as it does in the reference, and it should be preceded by a comma.
Even if you leave out the author name, include a comma and a space before the year to limit the search to
the Year field:

    {, 2001}

Record Number: The record number will always be unique for the library it resides in. However, it is not a
permanent number. If a reference is moved to a different library, it will be assigned a new record number. If it
is synchronized across computers or shared with colleagues through EndNote Sync, it will probably be
assigned a new number. If it is cut and then pasted back into the same library, it will be assigned a new
number. See Record Numbers. It is also possible to use the Accession Number or the Label fields in place
of record numbers for temporary citations (see Temporary Citations Preferences).The record number must
be preceded by a number sign:

    {Jones, 1987 #84}

Any Text: Any text that appears in the reference can be used to help EndNote locate the reference in the
library. In order for this to be helpful, select words that are unique to that reference. Enter the specific text
only or enter the text in place of the record number part of the temporary citation and after a second comma:

    {greenhouse}
    {Schwartz, 1990, any text}
    {Schwartz, , any text}

In the third example, where the date is omitted, you must insert a space between the two commas or
EndNote will not recognize any citation matches.

 Note: When using Any Text, EndNote will not search for whole words. If the text is part of a longer word, it
 will still be found. The more complete the information in the temporary citation, the better chance of a
 match. For example, you might find it helpful to follow the format used by EndNote online. EndNote online
 does not use record numbers for the third identifier; it uses the reference title. So an unformatted/
 temporary citation might look something like this: {Koepke, 2015, Delayed Gratification: A Grey Parrot
 (Psittacus erithacus) Will Wait for a Better Reward}.

Prefix Text: To add text to print before the formatted citation, type the text immediately after the opening
brace and then a backslash "\" to separate prefix text from the search text:

    {see \Jones, 1987 #84}

Suffix Text: To add text to print after a formatted citation, enter the suffix text immediately after the record
number or enter a third comma after the search text and then type the suffix text (the third comma will be
included in the formatted citation):

    {Smith, 1995 #98 p.293}
    {Smith, 1995, dinosaur, p.293}
    {Smith, 1995, #98, section 3}

 Note: Suffix text will always appear in the formatted citation. It is not dependent on the Cited Pages field
 being included in the style. This field can be used to add any type of information, not just page numbers.


    Page 212 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   Page Numbers: To add page numbers to a temporary citation, type @ and the page numbers after the
   record number. Page numbers require the Cited Pages field be included in the style and will be formatted
   according to the style settings.

       {Jones, 1987 #84@23}

   Page Numbers Only: If you have a citation where you want only the page numbers to appear, formatted
   according to a style that includes the Cited Pages field, remove both the Author and the Year from the
   temporary citation:

       {#95@53}

    Caution: This works well only when using a single library, without using EndNote Sync. When working
    with multiple libraries, or a library on multiple computers synchronized through EndNote Sync, there is a
    danger of having the same record number assigned to different references.

   Author (Year) format: To add a citation that is formatted as Author (Year) in your text, include @author-year
   after the pages designator:

       {Hesse, 2003 #95@@author-year}
          or
       {Hesse, 2003 #95@237@author-year}

   Bibliography Only format: To insert a citation that only appears in the bibliography, include @@hidden,
   where the first @ is needed as the pages placeholder:

       {Smith, 1995 #98@@hidden}

    Note: For an easy way to modify individual Cite While You Write citations once they are formatted, see
    Editing Citations in Microsoft Word.


Omitting Authors or Years from Citations
   While your style may normally include the author’s name and date in each in-text citation, you may want to
   omit the author and/or year from a particular citation. This is useful if you have mentioned the author or year
   in the context of the sentence and do not want to repeat the information in the citation.

   To remove the author’s name or date from a citation, leave that information out of the unformatted citation.

   To omit the author’s name, enter:

       ...Wyatt’s recent discovery {, 1993 #38}.

   which will format as:

       ...Wyatt’s recent discovery (1993).

   To omit the date, enter:

       ...about his 1993 discovery {Wyatt, #38}.

   which will format as:

       ...about his 1993 discovery (Wyatt).

       Page 213 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


    Note: Numbered citations do not print the author name or year in any case, so these settings would be
    ignored.

   If you want a reference to appear in your bibliography, but not as a citation in your paper, you can exclude
   both the author and year, leaving only the record number. When you format your paper with a style that
   formats authors and years in the citations, this particular citation will not display in text, but will be included
   in the bibliography.

   However, if you would rather have the author and year appear in the formatted citation regardless of
   whether or not they are in the temporary citation, select Preferences from EndNote’s Edit menu, select the
   Formatting option, and uncheck the setting to Omit Author and/or Year from formatted citation if removed
   from temporary citation. With this setting turned off, you may enter just the record number {#34} as a
   temporary citation, and still format the paper accurately with a style that requires authors and years in the in-
   text citations.

    Caution: The option immediately above works well only when using a single library, without using
    EndNote Sync. When working with multiple libraries, or a library on multiple computers synchronized
    through EndNote Sync, there is a danger of having the same record number assigned to different
    references.


    Note: For an easy way to modify individual Cite While You Write citations once they are inserted, see
    Editing Citations in Microsoft Word.


Citation Prefixes
   You can type a prefix in front of any unformatted in-text citation, using a backslash to separate the prefix text
   from the reference. For example, an in-text citation such as:

       {see also \Hall, 1988 #77}

   formatted in the APA style would be:

       (see also Hall, 1988)

   When there is only one prefix in a multiple citation and it is at the beginning of the citation, it will stay there
   regardless of how the citations are sorted. For example, this citation:

       {e.g. \Hall,1988 #77; Argus, 1991 #11}

   after being formatted in the APA style will appear as:

       (e.g. Argus, 1991; Hall, 1988)

   If the prefix is not at the beginning of the multiple citation, or if there is more than one prefix in a multiple
   citation, the prefix text remains with the reference it precedes. For example, this citation:

       {Argus, 1984 #11; especially \Hall, 1988 #77}

   formatted in the Author-Date style will be:

       (Argus, 1984; especially Hall, 1988)




       Page 214 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


Changing the Citation Prefix Marker

   You can change the prefix marker from a backslash to another character by selecting Preferences from
   EndNote’s Edit menu, selecting the Temporary Citations option, and changing the character in the Citation
   Prefix Marker box. Use a character that is not otherwise used in the citations. Letters, numbers, semicolons,
   "@," and commas cannot be prefix markers. See Citation Prefix Marker.


Citation Suffixes
   Text typed after the record number or search text in an unformatted citation appears immediately after the
   citation when it is formatted. For example, these citations:

       {Hall, 1988 #77, p. 5}
       {Smith, 1995 #58, section 3}

    after being formatted in the APA style will appear as:

       (Hall, 1988, p. 5)
       (Smith, 1995, section 3)

   In multiple citations, the suffix text remains with the citation that it follows, even if the citations are sorted
   differently during the formatting process. For example, this citation:

       {Hall, 1988 #77 p. 5; Argus, 1991 #11}

   formatted in the Author-Date style will be:

       (Argus, 1991; Hall, 1988 p. 5)

        Note: A space, punctuation mark, or letter should follow the record number, never a number. If a
        number appears directly after the record number, EndNote will interpret it as part of the record
        number.


Including Semicolons and Other Citation Delimiters in a Citation
   In order to print an actual semicolon or the prefix marker (\) as part of a citation, type an accent grave (`)
   before the character. The accent grave tells EndNote to treat the following character as regular text, and not
   as a significant character for parsing the citation (a delimiter). For example, to create a citation that is
   formatted as:

       (see Figure 1; Jackson, 1994)

   the unformatted citation must look like this:

       {see Figure 1`; \Jackson, 1994 #28}

   The ` character before the semicolon tells EndNote not to treat the semicolon as a separator between
   citations.

Citing Specific Page Numbers in Footnotes
  When citing full references in footnotes, you might want to include specific page numbers. EndNote provides
  a way to do this where the page numbers that you type into a temporary citation can be manipulated by the
  EndNote style just like a field in your EndNote reference. You can add specific pages to the temporary
  citation, and have the EndNote style include them wherever they need to be in the formatted citation. The
  style can also apply special pages formatting, like deciding whether to add "p." or "pp." before the page
  numbers, and how to list the range of pages.

  The easiest way to add cited pages is to use the Edit Citations dialog. See Editing Citations in Microsoft
  Word.

  To manually include specific page numbers to a reference in an unformatted footnote citation, enter the
  page number preceded by "@" at the end of the temporary citation:

      {Smith, 1999 #24@145-6}

  All text that follows the @ symbol (up to the next space) is considered the "Cited Pages." You must also
  configure the EndNote style used to format the paper to use "Cited Pages" in the footnote template. Most
  EndNote styles that require a special format for citations in footnotes are already configured this way.

  When EndNote formats the citation, the cited pages ("145-6" in the example above) are inserted in the
  correct location and formatted as appropriate for the style.

   Note: If you enter page numbers at the end of the temporary citation without the "@" character, they will
   still appear in a formatted in-text citation, but EndNote will not be able to manipulate them by changing the
   page format or by moving them to a different position in the formatted citation. They will appear, as
   entered, at the end of the formatted in-text citation. This is a perfectly acceptable way to enter page
   numbers for in-text citations (or for footnotes formatted just like your in-text citations). See Citation
   Suffixes to see how this works. This method will not work for citations in footnotes that are formatted as
   full bibliographic references or with a special footnote format. For those cases, you must use the @
   symbol to identify the cited pages in the temporary citation.


Examples of Modified Citations
  The following examples demonstrate how different modifications to a temporary citation affect its formatted
  citation in either an author/year or numbered style. In the first column is an example of a modified temporary
  citation before formatting, and to the right are two examples of that citation formatted in different styles.

Editing Citations in Microsoft Word
   Once you have inserted and formatted a citation, you should not edit it directly (even though you are able to
   do so). Direct edits are lost the next time EndNote formats the bibliography.

   You can almost always get EndNote to format your citations exactly to your specifications by editing the
   style, the EndNote reference, or the citation (as described here).

    Note: An easy way to omit the Author or Date from an individual citation is to select the citation, right-
    click, select Edit Citation(s) and then Exclude Author or Exclude Year.

   To edit a formatted citation:

      1. Click on the citation you wish to change.

      2. On the EndNote 2025 tab, click Edit & Manage Citation(s). All of the cited references in the
         document are listed, with the citation you clicked on selected. Each citation will show how it is
         formatted above the reference(s) for that citation, as a subheading within the list. Click on the
         Reference tab below the list to see details for the reference. Click on the Edit Citation tab below the
         list to edit the reference.

      3. Select the appropriate citation from the list and make any of the following changes to the highlighted
         citation:

          Default Format: Select this menu option to format the citation as defined by the currently selected
          output style.

          Display as: Author (Year): Select this menu option to display both the author name and the year in
          the highlighted citation, but with the author name appearing outside the parentheses for the citation.
          This feature does not apply when editing a citation in a footnote. When using this option with a
          numbered in-text style, the author name(s) will appear before the citation.

          Exclude Author: Select this to omit the author name from the formatted citation.

          Exclude Year: Select this to omit the date from the formatted citation.

          Show Only in Bibliography: Select this option to display the selected citation only in the
          bibliography, not in the body of the paper.

          Prefix: Enter text here to print at the beginning of the citation text (spaces are significant).

          Suffix: Enter text here to print at the end of the citation (spaces are significant).

          Pages: Enter page numbers here to show as Cited Pages, formatted according to the selected style.
          To show, the Cited Pages field must be included in the citation or footnote template of the output
          style.

      4. Within the Edit & Manage Citations window, you can add or remove citations from a multiple citation
         or change the order of citations.

          Insert Citation: Select this option from the drop-down menu at the right of the citation to add another
          citation within the same set of delimiters.

          Remove Citation: Highlight a citation, then select this option from the drop-down menu at the right
          of the citation to delete it from the in-text citation.

          Up and Down Arrows: Highlight a reference and use the arrows to the left of the citation to change
          the order of display within the citation. (If a Citation Sort Order is applied by the current output style,
          using this dialog to change the order of citations in a multiple citation has no effect.)

      5. Click OK to implement your change(s).

   On the EndNote 2025 tab, select Update Citations and Bibliography to reformat your bibliography with your
   changes.


Moving or Copying Citations in Microsoft Word
   You can highlight any text that includes citations, use the Cut or Copy commands, and then Paste the text
   elsewhere in the document. You can do this with formatted or temporary (unformatted) citations.

   To move or copy only the citation itself, make sure you highlight the entire citation (including surrounding
   delimiters). Then Cut or Copy and Paste it elsewhere in the document. If the entire field code for the citation
   is not included in the cut text, it could result in corrupted citations.

    Note: Some issues may arise when you use the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands in a document with
    Track Changes turned on. If this occurs, turn off Track Change when you use these edit commands.


Deleting Citations
   To delete an unformatted citation, highlight the entire citation (including delimiters), and press the
   Backspace or Delete key.

   While it is possible to highlight a formatted citation and press the delete key on your keyboard, we do not
   recommend that you do this. If you do not completely delete the citation and all associated codes, you could
   corrupt your citations.

   To safely delete a formatted citation:

      1. In Word, highlight the citation you want to delete.

      2. On the EndNote 2025 tab, select Edit & Manage Citation(s).

      3. In the Edit & Manage Citation(s) dialog, ensure that the citation you want to delete is highlighted. If
         the citation is part of a multiple citation, make sure you select just the citation you want to delete.

      4. From the drop-down menu at the right of the citation, select Remove Citation.

      5. Click OK.

Unformatting Citations in Microsoft Word
   Unformatting reverts formatted citations to temporary citations, removes the bibliography, and turns off
   instant formatting.

    Note: Unlike formatted citations, unformatted citations require that you have the original corresponding
    EndNote library open in order to format the paper again. Unformatting removes The Traveling Library. (A
    synced copy of the library will probably not work for reformatting the citations because the record numbers
    will be different. You should use the original copy of the library.)

   To unformat citations:

      1. Determine which citations you want to unformat:

           ▪ To unformat a particular citation, highlight only that citation.

           ▪ If the citation you want to unformat is part of a multiple citation, highlight the multiple citation. All
              citations within the delimiters will be unformatted.

           ▪ To unformat a section of the document, highlight that section.

           ▪ To unformat the entire document, either select nothing or highlight the entire document.
      2. On the EndNote 2025 tab, select Convert Citations and Bibliography, and then select Convert to
         Unformatted Citations. If you are unformatting the entire document, this unformats all of the in-text
         citations and removes the current bibliography.

   You can tell when a paper is unformatted because the citations appear in the temporary citation format
   (such as {Smith, 1999 #25}).

   Unformatted citations are temporary placeholders that do not reflect final output. You can format the paper
   again at any time. To save the formatted paper as text with formatted citations, see Removing Field Codes.

    Note: When you unformat citations, Instant Formatting in Microsoft Word is disabled. To format your
    paper, select Update Citations and Bibliography on the EndNote 2025 tab.



Generating Bibliographies

Adding Styles to the Output Styles Menu
   The bibliographic style selected determines how EndNote formats the citations in your paper and the
   references in the bibliography. The style defines the text styles, punctuation, and sorting required for the
   citations and bibliography, as well as which fields are included in the bibliography.

   You can use the Styles drop-down menu on the EndNote tab to select a different style and reformat your
   document at any point.

   For a typical installation, EndNote initially installs only the most popular output styles, although more styles
   are available. See Installing Additional Output Styles.

   To mark an installed output style as a favorite, so it will appear in the Styles menu:


       Page 220 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      1. In EndNote, go to the Tools menu, select Output Styles, and then select Open Style Manager.

      2. Find the style that you need.

          ▪ Select a style by typing its name or scroll through the list to find the style you need.

          ▪ Click on the column headings to sort the styles by either name or category. Click a second time to
             reverse the sort order.

          ▪ Use the Find by list to find entire categories of styles.
             The Style Info/Preview button can toggle between Style Info or Style Preview to display
             information about a style or a preview of how the selected style formats EndNote’s references.
             Use the More Info/Less Info toggle button to display or hide this dialog.

      3. Mark the box by a style to select it as one of your favorites. The Mark All button selects all styles.
         The Unmark All clears all selections.

      4. Close the Style Manager by selecting Close Style Manager from the File menu in the Style Manager.

   Styles marked as favorites appear in the Styles menu, wherever it appears.

   You can modify any style to meet your specifications. You can also create new styles if necessary.
   See Modifying Style Templates for more information.


Configure Categories Dialog in Microsoft Word
   This feature allows you to add categories to your Microsoft Word documents. When EndNote creates the
   bibliography in Word, it organizes your citations based on the categories set.

   There are two ways to create category configurations: Use a style with categories configured in it or
   configure custom categories manually. If using a style with categories configured already, you can still
   customize that configuration in Word.

Using Styles with Defined Categories

   Styles can include category definitions based on reference type. When using such a style, all references of
   a reference type defined in the Categories section of the style will automatically be sorted in Word. One
   example of such a style is APA 6th CV, which has the following preset categories.

      Publications
      Book
      Journal Article

      Manuscripts under review
      Unpublished Work

      Manuscripts in Progress
      Manuscript

      Conference Presentations
      Conference Proceedings

      Posters
      Conference Paper


       Page 221 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   Using or creating a style with categories defined makes it very easy to organize categories based on
   reference type, as long as all the reference types you are using are included in the style. See Reference
   Type Categories in Output Style for information on creating or editing styles with defined categories.

Group References by Custom Categories in Word Manually

   If you don't want to use a style with defined categories, or want to use categories that are not based on
   reference type, you can create your bibliography categories manually when you first begin writing a paper or
   at any time during a writing project.

      1. Open your Microsoft Word document.

      2. On the EndNote 2025 tab, select Categorize References > Configure Categories to open the
         Configure Categories dialog.

      3. Create your categories by clicking the Category Headings (+) button, entering the name of your new
         category, then pressing Enter. Repeat until you have created the categories you need for your paper.

      4. Using the drag-and-drop method, drag a specific reference to the appropriate category under the
         Category Headings section. A reference can only appear in one category.

      5. Continue this process until all references are assigned a category.

      6. Check the "Not Yet Assigned to a Category" section to ensure that all references have been
         assigned to a category.

   You can modify your categories at any time. For example, you can rename a category, delete a category,
   move a category, or move references (using drag-and-drop) from one category to another.

   The left panel contains two groups: References and Category Headings. See details below.

   The upper-right panel shows the list of references within the group or category selected at the left. The
   lower-right panel shows the details for the reference selected above.

References

   This section displays the references in your paper, and which of those references have not yet been
   categorized. Select a reference to see details for that reference at the right.

       ▪ All References in Bibliography: Select this group to see all the references in the bibliography in the
          right-side of the window. The following fields appear at the top of the right panel for each reference.

             ▪ Author

             ▪ Year

             ▪ Title (of publication)

             ▪ Reference Type

             ▪ Category (name of the category that you defined under the Category Headings section)
   The lower part of the panel displays detailed information about the reference. For example, Reference Type,
   Author, Year, Title, and more.




       Page 222 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       ▪ Uncategorized References: This displays each citation that has not been assigned to a category.
          Select a reference to see the details for that reference in the right panel. Use the drag-and-drop
          method to assign an unassigned citation to a category.

Category Headings

   This section displays all the categories that you have defined for the paper. The default categories for a new
   document containing categories, when your are not using a style, are Primary Sources and Secondary
   Sources. Create categories by clicking the Category Headings (+) button in the upper left corner of the
   dialog. This will display a blank text field. Enter a unique name to identify each category. For example:

       Category Headings
       References
       Suggested Reading

   To rename categories, select the category, then right-click and select Rename from the list. Type the new
   name for the category, then press Enter.

   Delete categories by clicking the minus sign (-) to the left of the category. Deleting a category does not
   delete any references from your paper. Any references assigned to that category will be added to the
   Uncategorized References list.

    Note: For the "Suggested Reading" category above, the references should appear in the bibliography but
    not in the text of the document. See the Show Only in Bibliography section of Editing Citations in Word for
    information on how to hide references in the text but have them appear in the bibliography.


Displaying the Categories in the Bibliography

   To display the references in your paper in the categories you have created, on the EndNote 2025 tab select
   Categorize References > Group References by Custom Categories. This is a toggle, so select the option to
   Group References by Custom Categories again if you ever want to disable the categories display.

Important Points About Categories

       ▪ Use styles with categories defined for automatically assigning references to categories based on
          reference type.

       ▪ Organize categories based on how you want the categories to appear in the bibliography in Word.

       ▪ Enter a unique name to identify each category that you want to create in the current document.

       ▪ Use drag-and-drop to add references to the appropriate bibliography categories.

       ▪ Go to the "Uncategorized References" list to see if any references have not been assigned to a
          category.

       ▪ If you delete a reference from a particular category, the reference is only removed from the category.
          The citation remains in your document and the reference goes back to the Uncategorized
          References section.

       ▪ EndNote maintains all references in the All References in Bibliography list. A reference added to any
          defined category will still appear in the All References list.

Creating a Bibliography from Multiple Documents
  For very large documents, you can use the Microsoft Word's Master Document feature to generate a single
  bibliography from multiple documents. This allows you to create a cumulative bibliography from any number
  of book chapters. (As an alternative for smaller documents, we recommend using a single Word document
  split into Sections. See Creating Multiple Bibliographies in a Single Document.)

  Master documents are used to assemble many smaller Word documents at the end of a project to create a
  single table of contents, bibliography, etc., when a single large document would be difficult to work with. A
  master document is usually used only for this final assembly, not for working in the individual documents.

  Before creating a master document, make a backup of all the documents you will be using for sections. A
  backup is always advisable before making large changes to any project, and how smoothly this process
  goes will depend on factors such as how consistent the formatting is for all the subdocuments and the
  master document. The present author always uses copies of documents when working with a master
  document and subdocuments.

  To generate a single bibliography:

     1. In each of your documents or chapters, insert your citations to link them to references in an EndNote
        library.

     2. In each document, on the EndNote tab, select Convert Citations and Bibliography > Convert to
        Unformatted Citations.

     3. Close all of your documents.

     4. Create a new document.

     5. Use the Outline view to designate the new document as a master document, then insert and display
        each of your chapters as subdocuments. (Check Word’s documentation if you need step-by-step
        instructions.)

     Note: If you have collapsed subdocuments to hide their content in Outline view, make sure you expand
     them in order to display the contents of all subdocuments before continuing.

     6. On the EndNote tab, in the Bibliography group, click the bottom corner arrow to open the Configure
        Bibliography dialog.

     Note: Your documents must allow read/write access; they cannot be designated Read-only (locked).

     7. Verify the formatting options and click OK.

  EndNote creates the bibliography, using citations from the master document and all displayed
  subdocuments, and places it at the end of the master document. You can move the bibliography anywhere
  within the master or subdocuments, and it will remain in that location even when you reformat.

   Note: If you select Word’s Insert > File command, and then select the Link option to insert a document
   into the text, EndNote will not format the linked document when you format the main document. The text
   from the linked document will be skipped.




      Page 224 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   If you want to format a bibliography for each subdocument plus a cumulative bibliography at the end of the
   master document, follow the instructions above, but use an output style that allows formatting of Sections.
   See Creating Multiple Bibliographies in a Single Document and Sections Options in Output Styles for
   additional information. In the case of a master document, subdocuments are treated as sections.


Creating Multiple Bibliographies in a Single Document
   By default, EndNote creates a single bibliography at the end of each of your Word documents. However,
   you may want to create a separate bibliography for each section (or chapter) in your document. Output style
   options are available so that you can choose to:

       ▪ Create a single, complete bibliography at the end of the document (the default setting for almost all
          of the supplied output styles).

       ▪ Create a bibliography for each section in the document.

       ▪ Create a bibliography for each section and also a complete bibliography at the end of the document.

In Microsoft Word, Break Your Document into Sections

   EndNote can format each section individually. You may want to break each chapter into its own section. In
   the case of a master document, subdocuments are treated as sections.

   In Word, on the Layout tab, click on Breaks, and then select one of the four options under Section Breaks:
   Next Page, Continuous, Even Page, or Odd Page.

Modify the Output Style as Needed

   If you are using the APA style and want to add bibliographies in sections, try APA 5th or 6th (sections).
   These styles are already defined to format a bibliography for each section, and do not require modification.

   Otherwise, we recommend that you start by copying an existing output style and giving it a unique name.
   This leaves the original style intact. See Copying Styles.

   Next, click on the Sections panel in the output style. This is where you select the appropriate option for
   creating a single bibliography from all sections, a separate bibliography for each section individually, or both.
   For a complete description of the formatting options for Microsoft Word sections, see Sections Options in
   Output Styles.

   Save your changes and close the output style.

Format Your Word Document with the New Output Style

   Format your bibliography as you normally would, but make sure you first select the new output style that you
   created. See Configuring the Bibliography in Microsoft Word.

Additional Formatting Notes

   When working with sections in Word, note that:

       ▪ EndNote will always insert a blank line between the final text of each section and the reference list
          for that section.




       Page 225 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       ▪ When you format a reference list at the end of each section, the bibliography title will be used from
          the Layout tab of the Configure Bibliography dialog. If you do not want a title for each section
          bibliography, make sure the "Bibliography Title" text box on the Layout tab is empty. See Configuring
          the Bibliography in Microsoft Word.

       ▪ If you have instructed the output style to “Create a bibliography for each section and a complete
          bibliography at the end of the document," but you have only one section in the Word document, a
          complete bibliography will appear twice—once for the end of the section, and once as a complete
          bibliography for the entire document.

       ▪ If you have multiple sections in your Word document, and switch from formatting with a style that
          formats sections individually to a style that formats a single, cumulative bibliography...you will see the
          section bibliographies disappear! If you want them back, make sure to format with a style that
          formats sections individually.

       ▪ Word inserts section breaks when changing between portrait and landscape orientations. If you need
          to change the page orientation in your document for wide graphics or tables, the orientation changes
          will be perceived as section breaks for bibliographies when using the Sections feature in an EndNote
          style.


Deleting Bibliographies
   To delete a bibliography, make sure Instant Formatting in Microsoft Word is disabled, select the bibliography,
   and then delete it.

   Make sure you drag the cursor across the very beginning of the bibliography to select the entire bibliography
   field. Press the Backspace or Delete key. You can also cut the bibliography if you want to paste it
   somewhere else (see Moving Bibliographies in Microsoft Word).


Directly Editing Bibliographies
   It is always best to make changes to your final bibliography by correcting the data in the EndNote library,
   editing the output style you are using, or adding or deleting citations from your paper. Then, after making the
   necessary changes, format the bibliography to make the corrections automatically.

   It is not always possible for EndNote to format the bibliography exactly as needed, so you might need to
   manually edit the formatted bibliography. If you must do this, remember that if you reformat a paper after
   editing the bibliography, EndNote will not preserve your edits. When EndNote reformats a bibliography, it
   deletes the existing one and puts a new one in its place.

   You can edit the bibliography as you would any text. The bibliography may be shaded, but you can still edit
   it. If you later reformat the paper, your edits will be gone.

   You can add text after the bibliography, but make sure to put it after the end of the formatted bibliography—
   outside of the bibliography field.

    Note: See Modifying Style Templates.


Generating Bibliographies
   Formatting a bibliography serves two functions:

       ▪ It formats each in-text citation according to the selected bibliographic style.

       Page 226 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       ▪ It adds a complete bibliography to the document (unless you override this with a setting in the output
          style).

       ▪ The format used for citations and references is determined by the output style selected. When you
          have finished writing your paper in Word, and all of your EndNote citations have been inserted into
          the text, you are ready for EndNote to format the paper and generate a bibliography. This can be
          done in one of these ways:

           ▪ Instant Formatting actually works as you insert citations and is enabled when you first start using
              Cite While You Write. EndNote uses the currently selected style to format citations and update
              the bibliography each time a citation is inserted. However, if you want to change the style or
              layout of references, you can use the Format Bibliography tab from the Configure Bibliography
              dialog. See Configuring the Bibliography in Microsoft Word.

           ▪ Configure Bibliography allows you to modify bibliography preferences such as style and layout
              before formatting your document.

           ▪ Update Citations and Bibliography is available on the EndNote tab in Word. EndNote uses the
              currently selected style to format the citations, the bibliography, plus figures and tables. You
              could also select a new style from the Style list in the Bibliography group.

   On the EndNote tab, in the Bibliography group, click the bottom corner arrow to open the Configure
   Bibliography dialog.

      1. On the Format Bibliography tab, use the With Output Style option to select an output style to format
         references.

      2. Click OK to format all citations and build the bibliography.



Configuring the Bibliography in Microsoft Word
   The Configure Bibliography dialog allows you to customize options for the citations and bibliography beyond
   those set in the style.

   You may be halfway through inserting citations or you may have finished writing your paper. You may have
   instant formatting enabled or you may have manually inserted citations with formatting disabled. It does not
   matter. As long as you have citations entered in your document, you can format your paper at any time.

    Note: The first time a citation is formatted, the corresponding EndNote library must be open. After that,
    EndNote can use The Traveling Library for reference information.

   To format citations and generate a bibliography:

      1. On the EndNote tab, click the bottom corner arrow in the Bibliography group.

      2. On the Format Bibliography tab, change or verify these settings.

          Format document: Make sure the appropriate Word document is selected from the list of open
          Word documents.

          With output style: Select the appropriate output style to format references. You can experiment by
          reformatting with various output styles. To add more output styles to the list, see Adding Styles to the
          Output Styles Menu.

         Temporary citation delimiters: These are the opening and closing delimiters for temporary
         citations. Make sure they are unique delimiters, and not characters you would normally use in your
         paper. The defaults are curly braces.

         Link in-text citations to references in the bibliography: This option is selected by default,
         creating hyperlinks between in-text citations and their corresponding references in the bibliography.
         Clear the selection to remove links between in-text citations and their matching references in the
         bibliography.

          Note: Links between citations and bibliography entries only works with in-text citations. You
          cannot link between full-reference footnotes or endnotes and their matching bibliography entries.
          Author-date citations within Word footnotes or endnotes can be linked, but not full-reference
          footnotes or endnotes.

         Underline linked in-text citations: Select this option to add underlines to in-text citations. Clear the
         checkbox to remove underlines from in-text citations in your paper. This option is only available if the
         "Link in-text citations to references in the bibliography" checkbox is selected.

     3. On the Layout tab, change or verify these settings:

         Font and Size: These are the text font and size used for the bibliography.

         Bibliography Title: To print a title at the top of your bibliography, type the title in this text box. This
         title will always be centered. If you want to use Word's formatting options for the bibliography title,
         perhaps to match headings being at the left in your paper, leave this field blank and add a title above
         the bibliography manually.

         Text Format: Highlight the bibliography title text and then use the Text Format button to display a
         dialog where you can change the format of the highlighted text.

         Start with Bibliography Number: Enter a starting reference number if you want a numbered
         bibliography to start with a number other than one. This works only for in-text numbered styles; it
         does not affect footnotes or endnotes.

         First Line Indent and Hanging indent: Use these settings to set a paragraph indent (where the first
         line of a paragraph is indented), a hanging indent, or no indent at all. The hanging indent applies to
         the second and subsequent lines of a reference in the bibliography. Type measurements as
         centimeters (cm), inches (in), lines (li), or points (pt).

         Line Spacing and Space After: Set the Line spacing for within a reference and the Space after for
         spacing between references.

     4. Click OK to save changes and format your citations and bibliography.

   Note: You do not have to verify each tab every time you format. Changes set will remain in effect until you
   change them manually.


Moving Bibliographies in Microsoft Word
  Cite While You Write always creates the initial bibliography at the end of the Word document. If you move
  the bibliography to a different location in the document, EndNote keeps it there even if you reformat the

   paper. You can drag-and-drop the bibliography, or, if Instant Formatting is disabled, you can Cut and Paste
   the bibliography.

   If you unformat all the citations in the document, then format a new bibliography, it will again be placed at
   the end of the document. Unformatting removes the Word codes for the new location of the bibliography.

    Note: When Instant Formatting is enabled, use drag-and-drop to move a bibliography, not Cut and Paste.
    If you try to use Cut and Paste, Instant Formatting will create a new bibliography at the end of the
    document before you have a chance to Paste.


Instant Formatting in Microsoft Word
   Instant Formatting works while you write your paper. As you insert citations, EndNote uses the currently
   selected style to format citations and update the bibliography. By default, Instant Formatting is enabled the
   first time you insert a citation or format the bibliography.

   To turn Instant Formatting on or off, use the Instant Formatting is On/Off toggle on the EndNote tab.

   For new documents or documents that have never been formatted, when Instant Formatting is enabled, it is
   not triggered when you manually type a reference into a document. You must use the the EndNote tab in
   Word to either insert another citation or format the citations and a reference list. If a document has been
   successfully formatted and you manually type in a temporary citation, that citation is instantly formatted.

   To enable or disable Instant Formatting in the current document, on the EndNote tab, select your preferred
   option from the Instant Formatting is On/Instant Formatting is Off drop-down. It is a toggle which will show
   the current status of Instant Formatting in the tab.

   To set preferences for Instant Formatting, on the EndNote tab, select the Turn Instant Formatting Is On/
   Instant Formatting Is Off drop-down, then select Configure Instant Formatting. Set your options for the two
   choices shown below, then click OK to close and save your changes.

       ▪ Scan for temporary citations turns on scanning of temporary citations. This finds and formats all
          citations, including those you may have entered manually. You can select how often EndNote scans
          your document.

       ▪ Check for citation changes turns on background scanning that looks for citation changes.
   When Instant Formatting is enabled, leaving the Configure Bibliography dialog will always trigger formatting
   in your document.

    Note: To turn Instant Formatting on or off for new Word documents, see General Preferences in Microsoft
    Word


Reformatting Papers in Microsoft Word

Adding New Citations to Formatted Papers

   If you add more citations to your paper after the formatting process, you can update the citations and the
   bibliography by clicking Update Citations and Bibliography or by using the Configure Bibliography dialog. To
   open the Configure Bibliography dialog, on the EndNote tab click the bottom corner arrow in the
   Bibliography group.



       Page 229 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


    Note: You do not need to unformat your citations in order to reformat them.


Reformatting with Different Styles

   To reformat your paper in a different style, select the new style from the drop-down Styles menu on the
   EndNote tab. Your citations and bibliography are updated for the new bibliographic style. See Adding Styles
   to the Output Styles Menu for information about expanding the list of available styles.


Inserting and Formatting Figures and Tables
   Once images are organized in an EndNote library, they are available for inserting into a manuscript with Cite
   While You Write commands. The finishing touch is the automatic creation of a figure list and/or a table list
   that presents a sequential list of all graphics inserted in a manuscript from EndNote. Graphics not inserted
   from EndNote will not appear in figure or table lists.

   A figure citation is a brief numbered citation in the body of a paper that refers the reader to a figure at the
   end of the paragraph or to a figure in a complete list of figures at the end of the paper.

   In-text figure citations are sequentially numbered and formatted like this:

       Marrella is a small "arthropod" somewhat reminiscent of a trilobite. This
       illustration also shows the dark "blob" produced by body contents which were
       squeezed out of the animal after burial. (Figure 1)

   It includes the word "Figure" (or "Table"), the sequential number, and surrounding parentheses. The field
   may be shaded by Word to help you see citations, but shading does not print. You can turn field shading off
   in Word.

   The current output style determines the placement of formatted figures and tables. They appear either within
   the body of the paper, directly after the paragraph where they are cited, or in a list at the end of the
   document, after the bibliography.

    Note: Figure citations are not bibliographic citations and will not appear in the bibliography. If the figure is
    from a reference, you must insert the reference as a citation separately to have it appear in the
    bibliography.

   See Finding and Inserting Figures and Tables.


Notes About Formatting Figures and Tables

       ▪ Do not use Microsoft Word Captioning in conjunction with EndNote figure captioning or in-text
          citations.

       ▪ Images found in the "Chart or Table" reference type are inserted into word as tables, which are
          labeled and numbered separately from figures. (You still use the generic Insert Figure command.)

       ▪ If you open an existing document that already has figure citations in the body (that were not inserted
          with EndNote’s Insert Figure command), those figures will not be included in the figure list. You will
          need to add the existing figures to references in EndNote, and then use the Insert Figure command
          to insert them into the document.




       Page 230 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       ▪ You can format figures either directly after the paragraph in which they are cited or in a list at the end
          of the document. See Figures and Tables Preferences in Microsoft Word.

       ▪ The Instant Formatting that applies to bibliographies does not apply to figures. In-text figure citations
          are always formatted as you insert them, but if you move or delete a figure citation in your paper, you
          must select Update Citations and Bibliography on the EndNote tab.

       ▪ Figure and table captions are added from the Caption field in the EndNote reference.

       ▪ If more than one in-text figure citation references the same figure with the same caption, those
          citations are assigned the same figure number, and the figure appears only once in a figure list.

       ▪ You can manually insert a page break between figures if you prefer each figure on a separate page.
          These page breaks will be remembered if you select Update Citations and Bibliography again.


Finding and Inserting Figures and Tables
   You can search EndNote references and insert a graphic or file from the figure field of a reference into your
   Word document. The figure field in your references may be titled figure or have a custom name assigned by
   you.

    Note: The file types accepted are dependent on your version of Word and other software installed on your
    computer.

   To insert a graphic or file that is stored in an EndNote reference:

      1. Open the EndNote library that contains the figure you wish to insert.

      2. In the Word document, position the cursor at the location where you would like the figure citation to
         appear.

      3. On the EndNote tab in Word, select the Insert Citation drop-down menu, and then select Insert
         Figure.

      4. In the text box at the top, enter text to identify the reference that contains the figure. EndNote
         assumes an "and" between each word, and will search all fields in your records, including the
         Caption field.

      5. Click Find, and EndNote compares the text to text in your EndNote references and lists each
         matching reference that contains an image.

          EndNote displays the Author, Year, Title, and Caption field from each matching reference. Drag the
          vertical bars between the column titles to display more or less of a field. The Caption column should
          contain the contents of the record's Caption field.

      6. Select and insert the appropriate figure.

          If no references match your text, try modifying your search.

   EndNote places an in-text figure citation at the cursor location, and inserts and labels the figure itself in the
   location set by the style.

    Note: Images found in the "Chart or Table" reference type are inserted into Word as tables, which are
    labeled and numbered separately from figures.


       Page 231 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   The figure or table number represents the order of the image in the document.

   You can insert figures and tables in an existing manuscript or as you write. Remember to save your
   document as you work.

    Note: The Instant Formatting that applies to bibliographies does not apply to figures. In-text figure
    citations are always formatted as you insert them, but if you move or delete a figure citation in your paper,
    you must click Update Citations and Bibliography to update your changes.


Updating Figures and Tables
   In-text figure citations are always formatted as you insert them. The graphic will appear in the location set in
   the style.

   If you move or delete a figure citation in your paper, you must manually generate the figure list to update the
   figure citation numbering and placement.

   On the EndNote tab, select Update Citations and Bibliography.

   EndNote will number each figure and table citation sequentially in the Word document, as shown in this
   example:

       This family tree is not a chronological progression. Rather, it illustrates
       how evolution incorporates traits that evolved for unrelated reasons into a
       novel structure. (Table 1)

       Marella is a small "arthropod" somewhat reminiscent of a trilobite. This
       illustration also shows the dark "blob" produced by body contents which were
       squeezed out of the animal after burial. (Figure 1)

       As researchers look at evidence, even the crest on the modern cockatiel
       provides insight into the evolution of feathers. (Figure 2)

   EndNote also inserts and displays the actual figures (graphics, figures, tables, charts, equations, or files)
   and labels them with figure or table numbers (to match each in-text reference) and caption text from the
   Caption field in the EndNote reference.

   If your figures are listed at the end of the document:

       ▪ In a figure or table list, if more than one citation references the same figure with the same caption,
          those citations are assigned the same figure number, and the figure appears only once in the list.

       ▪ You can continue to add figure citations to the Word document. If you change the position of figure
          citations in your document (with the Copy and Paste commands), select Update Citations and
          Bibliography again to update figures and tables.

       ▪ You can manually insert a page break between figures if you prefer each figure on a separate page.
          These page breaks will be remembered if you generate the figure list again. Or, direct the output
          style to always insert page breaks between figures.


Placing Figures and Tables
   Figures and tables are formatted either after the paragraph where cited or in a list at the end of the
   manuscript. This placement is determined by the current output style.


       Page 232 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


    Note: Images from any reference type other than "Chart or Table" are inserted and formatted as Figures.
    Images from the "Chart or Table" reference type are inserted and formatted as Tables. Both are inserted
    with the Insert Figure command. Both are formatted with the Update Citations and Bibliography
    command .


Automatic Placement by the Output Style

   The selected output style determines where figures and tables are initially placed in a document and when
   you Update Citations and Bibliography.

   By default, most output styles are set up to place figures and tables immediately after the paragraph in
   which they are cited. You can edit individual output styles to place figures and tables either after the
   paragraph in which they are cited or in a list at the end of the document.

   For information about editing your output style for figure placement, see Figures and Tables. The Figures
   panel determines the placement of figures and their captions, the Tables panel determines the placement of
   tables (images from the Chart or Table reference type) and their captions, and the Separation and
   Punctuation panel determines image separation and punctuation of labels and captions.

Selecting a Different Output Style

   To apply a different output style in Word, on the EndNote tab, select the new style from the Styles drop-
   down menu.

   The output style choice affects both bibliographic citations and figure and table citations.

Cite While You Write Override of the Output Style

   As you work in your document, you may adjust the placement of actual figures and tables by cutting the
   pictures and pasting them elsewhere in the document. Normally, when the figure list is generated again, the
   output style puts them back in their initial location. You can override the output style, and tell EndNote to
   leave existing figures and tables where they are currently placed. See Figures and Tables Preferences in
   Microsoft Word for information about Cite While You Write preferences that affect Figures and Tables.


Moving Figures and Tables

Moving In-text Figure and Table Citations

   To move or copy a figure or table citation:

      1. Select the entire citation, including the surrounding parentheses. For example: (Figure 1).

      2. Use Copy (Ctrl+C) or Cut (Ctrl+X) commands to copy or move the citation from its current location,
         then the Paste (Ctrl+V) command to put the citation in its new location. You can also use drag-and-
         drop to move a figure citation.

      3. On the EndNote tab, select Update Citations and Bibliography to renumber the in-text citations and
         update figures and tables.

   The selected output style determines whether figures and tables appear directly after the paragraph where
   cited or in a list at the end of the document. To modify this section of your output style, see Figures and
   Tables.



       Page 233 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


Moving Individual Figures and Tables

   To move an individual figure or table within the text of the manuscript:

      1. Cut the figure (or table), including the label and caption, and Paste it in the appropriate position in
         your manuscript.

      2. On the EndNote tab, select Preferences.

      3. On the Figures and Tables tab, select the bottom button for custom placement of figures and tables
         and click OK.

      4. On the EndNote tab, select Update Citations and Bibliography.

   EndNote will update figure and table numbering, but will not change the position of existing figures and
   tables. See Figures and Tables Preferences in Microsoft Word.

    Note: This custom placement is honored only when the current output style is set up to print figures and
    tables within the text of the manuscript. When the output style is set up to list figures and tables in lists at
    the end of the document, regenerating the figure list will move figures and tables to the appropriate list at
    the end of the document.


Moving Figure and Table Lists

   When an output style is modified to print figures and tables in a list at the end of a document, the lists
   appear after the bibliography. However, you may want the list to appear elsewhere in your document. Some
   publishers even require that figures be provided in a separate file.

   To move a figure or table list elsewhere in your document, such as before the bibliography:

      1. Select the entire list, especially the very beginning of the list which contains a hidden marker.

      2. Cut the list to move it to the Clipboard.

      3. Move the cursor to the new location.

      4. Paste the Clipboard contents at the new location.

   Each time you select Update Citations and Bibliography, EndNote looks for the beginning marker, so the list
   will be updated in its current location.

   If multiple in-text figure citations reference the same figure with the same caption, those citations are
   assigned the same figure number, and the figure appears only once in a figure list.

   To provide a figure or table list in a separate file:

      1. Finalize your manuscript and figure list.

      2. Select the entire list, and then use the Copy and Paste commands to paste the list into another Word
         document.

      3. Delete the figure or table list from the manuscript file.

    Note: Do not select Update Citations and Bibliography again within either document.


       Page 234 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


Deleting a Figure Citation or Figure List
   To delete a figure or table citation:

      1. Highlight the entire citation, including the surrounding parentheses.

      2. Press the Backspace or Delete key.

      3. On the EndNote tab, select Update Citations and Bibliography to renumber the remaining in-text
         figure and table citations and update the formatted figures and tables.

   To delete a figure or table list:

       ▪ To remove a single figure or table from the list, delete the corresponding in-text figure citation. Then,
           use Update Citations and Bibliography to generate an updated list at the end of the document.

       ▪ If you want to completely remove the figure or table list, first delete all in-text figure citations and
           update the list with Update Citations and Bibliography. Then, to completely remove any mention of a
           figure or table list, select the List of Figures marker or List of Tables marker and press Delete.

    Note: Do not delete the figure (picture) itself from the document. Remove the in-text figure citation and
    then Update Citations and Bibliography. If you do not remove the in-text citation, regenerating the figure
    list will use the in-text citation to display the picture again!



Sharing Your Word Documents
   You can directly share your Word files with colleagues. Each formatted citation is surrounded by field codes
   that contain reference information (see The Traveling Library), so colleagues may not even need access to
   your library to add citations or update the bibliography.

   If you want to convert your document for use with a previous version of Word or a different word processor,
   you should Unformat Citations before saving in the different file format. Then, you may be able to reformat.
   The corresponding EndNote library (or libraries) must be available in order to format. See Unformatting
   Citations in Word.

   To send a final, formatted document to someone, you may want to remove the field codes to save the
   formatted citations and bibliography as text. See Removing Field Codes.

   Of course, if you just want to print a copy of the paper for someone, you do not need to do anything to your
   document other than print it!

   If you are working collaboratively with a colleague and would like to share your library as well as your
   documents, see About Shared Libraries and Working on Different Computers with Word.


The Traveling Library
   Each formatted citation in your Word document is saved with field codes that embed reference data in the
   document. The paper contains a "Traveling Library" of references cited. See Field Codes in Microsoft Word.

   The first time a citation is formatted, EndNote looks in the open library and finds the corresponding
   reference. If you later reformat, EndNote again looks in the open library for that reference. However, if the
   library is not available or not open, EndNote uses the Traveling Library for reference information.



       Page 235 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   Because reference data is kept with each formatted citation, you can collaborate with other authors on a
   paper without each author having the same EndNote library.

   The reference data saved with each citation includes all fields except Notes, Research Notes,
   Abstract, Figure, and Caption.

    Note: Do not unformat your document if you do not have the original references in your libraries. Unlike
    formatted citations, unformatted citations require that you have the corresponding EndNote libraries open
    in order to format references.


Exporting Word’s Traveling Library to an EndNote Library
   There may be occasions where you want to copy all of the references used in a Microsoft Word document to
   an EndNote library. Perhaps you received only the formatted Word document from a colleague, and would
   like to create EndNote references to use later. Or, you may have a large EndNote library, but want to create
   a smaller EndNote library with only the subset of references used in your paper.

    Note: The Traveling Library does not contain Notes, Research Notes, Abstracts, Figures, or Captions.

   To export references from a Word document to an EndNote library:

      1. Open the document in Word.

      2. On the EndNote 2025 tab, select Export to EndNote, and then select Export Traveling Library.

      3. On the Export Traveling Library dialog, select either:

          ▪ An existing EndNote library: Select a library from the drop-down list of open libraries, or click
             Browse to locate a library.

          ▪ A new EndNote library: You will be prompted to name and save the new library.

    Notes: We recommend that you export to a new EndNote library, so you can review the records before
    adding them to an existing library.

    When you use the Export Traveling Library command, the exported references are renumbered and do
    not retain their original record numbers.


Converting Word Citations to EndNote
   Word includes a Reference tab, where you can keep a database of references and use commands to insert
   them into Word documents as citations. These citations are not used by EndNote’s Cite While You Write
   feature. If you have references already entered into Word, or citations using Word's data format in a
   document, you can copy the reference information into an EndNote library and then convert the Word
   citations into EndNote Cite While You Write citations.

    Note: The Word citation conversion features requires that your computer have the Microsoft .Net
    Framework installed.

   To export Word document citations to an EndNote library:



       Page 236 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      1. Open the Word document that contains the citations.

      2. On the EndNote 2025 tab, select Export to EndNote, and then select Export Word Citations.

   To export the Word master citation list (this may include references not used in the paper) to an EndNote
   library:

      1. Open the Word document that contains the citations.

      2. From the EndNote 2025 tab, select Export to EndNote, and then select Export Word Master List.

   To convert Word citations to EndNote citations within the document:

      1. Open the Word document that contains the citations.

      2. From the EndNote tab, select Convert Citations and Bibliography, and then Convert Word Citations
         to EndNote.


Working on Different Computers
   If you are working on a paper and moving between different computers, you will want to have access to
   the references needed for your paper wherever you are. EndNote gives you options for accessing your
   references on different computers, as well as options for sharing those references with colleagues who may
   be working on the paper with you.

EndNote Sync and Sharing

   EndNote Sync allows you to synchronize the references in your library to multiple computers. EndNote Sync
   does not synchronize the library as a whole; it creates a new library on the second (or third, or fourth, etc.)
   computer(s) and synchronizes all the reference data within the library to the new computer. Terms lists are
   not synchronized, and record numbers change during this process, but all the reference data remains intact
   from the original library. See The Sync Feature for information on syncing an EndNote library.

   After a library is synced, the library can be shared with other EndNote desktop users. See About Shared
   Libraries for information on sharing your library with other EndNote users.

    Caution: Avoid unformatting your citations and bibliography if using EndNote Sync or Sharing; the record
    numbers for the same references may be different on each computer. To work with unformatted citations,
    you need the record numbers used in the library the citations were originally inserted from; the record
    numbers in a synced library are unlikely to match.


Sharing Groups through EndNote Online

   EndNote Sync synchronizes your references with your EndNote account, making them available from
   anywhere through a Web interface. These references can also be used in Word with Cite While You Write.
   You will have access to all the references in your EndNote account, and also have the ability to share just
   selected groups with collaborators. This may be a preferred option when you don't want to share your entire
   library. See Using Cite While You Write with EndNote Online for information on switching between using
   your desktop and online libraries in a paper; see Sharing Groups for information on sharing groups in your
   EndNote library.

The Traveling Library

   The Traveling Library refers to a copy of the reference data from your EndNote library embedded in the
   Word field codes of the paper. Most of the time you don't see the contents of those field codes, you see the
   results of them: formatted EndNote citations. Only the reference data for citations used in the paper is
   included. Because that data is present in the paper, colleagues can add EndNote citations, or even change
   the EndNote Style, and the paper will be updated to include both your citations and those added by your
   colleague. You can find more information on the field codes used in Field Codes in Microsoft Word.


Saving Files for Other Versions of Word and Other Word Processors
   Formatted citations are Word "fields" specific to the version of Word that created them and the other
   compatible versions (Microsoft Word 2010, 2013, 2016, 2019, 2021, or Office 365).

   If you open your document with a different version of Word, or use the Save As command to save a
   formatted copy of your paper in another format, you may lose the ability to format citations in that document.

   If you plan to use your document with a different word processor or an earlier version of Microsoft Word, you
   should either Unformat Citations or Remove Field Codes (Convert to Plain Text) from the Word file before
   converting the document to the other file format.

       ▪ Unformatting Citations: Unformatted citations are regular text; however, they are temporary
          placeholders that do not reflect final output. See Unformatting Citations in Microsoft Word. You may
          be able to unformat citations, save the document as an RTF file, and use Format Paper with the
          original library the citations came from to format citations from these placeholders. Because Format
          Paper has no travelling library, the record numbers for the unformatted citations must match the
          record numbers in the library. See Basic Instructions for Using Format Paper for information on using
          Format Paper.

       ▪ Removing Field Codes: When you remove field codes, you save a copy of the document and
          convert formatted fields to regular formatted text. Graphics are no longer linked, but are saved as
          though you had used the Copy and Paste commands. The copy reflects final, formatted output, but
          you cannot reformat later. See Removing Field Codes.

   For information about using your Word document with OpenOffice.org Writer, see Moving Documents
   between Microsoft Word and Writer.


Submitting the Final Paper to a Publisher
   Many publishers ask that you submit an electronic copy of your paper in addition to a printed copy. Because
   the field codes in your document may be incompatible with the publishing software, you may be asked to
   submit a copy of your paper without field codes, as described in Removing Field Codes.

   If your publisher uses EndNote, they may ask you to leave the field codes intact, enabling them to easily
   make changes to the citations or bibliography, if needed.


Removing Field Codes
   You may need to remove Cite While You Write field codes in order to share your document with a publisher
   or colleague. See Field Codes in Microsoft Word for information on field codes.

       ▪ If your colleague is using the same version of Word that you are, you can share your formatted
          document as is; the document includes a Traveling Library, which includes all required information
          for the formatted citations and bibliography. See The Traveling Library.

       Page 238 of 631
    Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


    ▪ If your colleague is using a different word processor or an incompatible version of Word, you could
       remove field codes to share your final document. However, removing field codes saves the formatted
       citations and bibliography as text, and does not allow reformatting.

    ▪ Removing field codes means deleting Word’s Cite While You Write field codes and saving the
       formatted citations and bibliography as text. This removes only Cite While You Write field codes, and
       not all other Word field codes.

    ▪ When field codes are removed, in-text figure citations are no longer linked to an EndNote reference
       or to the figure list. In-text figure citations become plain text. Pictures in the figure list become picture
       files, as though they were copied and pasted into the document.

    ▪ Because EndNote and Cite While You Write cannot reformat or unformat your paper once field codes
       are removed, the Convert to Plain Text command makes a copy of your document without codes.

 Note: If you are working with master and subdocuments in Word, the Convert to Plain Text command
 warns that it will strip codes from the original documents. You should first manually save copies of the
 master and subdocuments, and then remove codes from the copies.

To remove field codes and save the formatted citations and bibliography as text:

   1. Open your formatted Word document. If it is a new document and has not been saved, save it before
      removing field codes.

       If you are working with Master and Subdocuments, work with copies of your documents.

   2. On the EndNote 2025 tab, select Convert Citations and Bibliography, and then Convert to Plain Text.
      Click OK in the confirmation dialog to create a new document. A copy of the document, without field
      codes, appears in a new document window.

   3. From the File menu, select Save.

       ▪ Single document: In Word’s Save As dialog, type a new name for this copy of your document
          and click OK.

       ▪ Master and Subdocuments: You may be advised to save a copy of the master and each
          subdocument.

Word saves your document without embedded formatting codes, so you can submit your paper to a
publisher or share your final paper with a colleague using a different word processor (including a different
version of Word).

 Note: The copy does not contain Cite While You Write field codes, so you cannot reformat with Cite While
 You Write. To reformat, start with the original document, which retains field codes.

If you find that removing EndNote field codes produces undesired layout or other formatting changes to your
document, you can remove all Microsoft Word field codes, which may yield better results.

To remove all Microsoft Word field codes:

   1. First save a backup copy of your document, because this will irretrievably remove the links between
      your document and your EndNote libraries as well as all other Word field codes.

   2. Select all text in the document by pressing Ctrl+A.


    Page 239 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


     3. Press Ctrl+6 to remove all Microsoft Word field codes from the document (not just Cite While You
        Write codes!) and leave the text, citations, and bibliography as they appear. (Be sure to use the
        number 6 on your keyboard, not the 6 on the keypad. For most U.S. keyboards, this will be the key
        that also includes the caret (^) symbol.)


Paperpal Preflight Presubmission Check

    desktop, and temporary citations cannot be edited manually. All citations must be added and edited
    through the tools in the EndNote sidebar.

    If your organization has a site license for EndNote, your site license administrator may arrange for the
    EndNote add-in to be automatically installed for all accounts within the organization. In this case, you will
    see the EndNote button on the References tab automatically.




How to Cite While You Write in Word Online
   The steps required to cite a reference and generate a bibliography with Word Online are given below.


       Page 242 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


  First, open the EndNote sidebar and set your viewing options:

     1. Open the document you are writing in Word Online to enable the Word Online toolbar.

     2. Select the References tab, then click the EndNote button.

     3. If prompted, log in to your EndNote Web account within Word Online. When you are logged in, you
        should see the EndNote sidebar appear at the right of the screen. Select My references to show the
        references in your EndNote Web library.

     4. If you have a large library and wish to limit your search for references to a specific custom group in
        your library, select the All References drop-down, and then select the group you want from the list.
        The All References label will then change to the name of your group, as in the example shown
        below.




  When you have arranged the add-on sidebar to your preferences, you are ready to begin citing references.



Inserting References in a Word Online Document
  To insert citations in the document, search for them in your library, then insert them in the document
  following the steps below.

  If you have not already done so, open your document and the EndNote add-in in Word Online. (See How to
  Cite While You Write in Word Online.)




      Page 243 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      1. If you have chosen to keep references for specific documents in custom groups, set the custom
         group created for your document as the group to be searched. (See How to Cite While You Write in
         Word Online.)

      2. Position the cursor in the text where you would like to put the citation.

      3. In the Search References field in the sidebar, enter a word or or set of words for the reference(s)
         you want to find. Keep these tips in mind when searching for references.

          a. Remember, you can search all your references or just the references within a specific group. If
             you have a large library, setting up a custom group for each document in advance with only the
             references used for that document will allow you to limit your search to the references for that
             document.

          b. If you use multiple search terms, by default you will expand the search rather than narrow it
             down. For example, the search parrot crow will find any reference with parrot or crow in it,
             not just the references that contain both terms. Here are methods for narrowing your search
             results:
               (1) To create a search expression equivalent to "text AND text," add a plus sign before any
                   word that must be in the record you are looking for. For example, +parrot +crow will
                   find records that contain both terms in the same record, although they may not be in the
                   same field.
               (2) To find records that contain a phrase, put the phrase in double quotation marks. For
                   example, "grey parrot" will find only the records that include that phrase somewhere
                   in the record.
               (3) To omit records that contain a word, put a minus sign before any word that must not be in
                   the record. For example, +parrot -crow will find any records that include the word
                   parrot but exclude any records in that set of results that contain the word crow.

          c. If you need to find both singular and plural versions of a search term, or multiple terms with a
             common root, use an asterisk (*) at the end of the search term. For example, if you want to find
             both crow and crows, type crow* in the search field; for intelligent or intelligence, type
             intelli*. So, to add to the hints in b. above, to search for grey parrot or grey parrots as a
             phrase, type "grey parrot*" in the search field.

      4. Select the found references to insert in the document.

      5. Click the Insert Citation button at the bottom of the sidebar.

      6. When you have finished inserting citations, click the Update citations & bibliography button at the
         bottom of the sidebar to create or update your bibliography.


   Note: In the instructions above, any words in the red Courier New font are search term example words.




Selecting an EndNote Style in Word Online
  EndNote includes over 7,500 reference styles for formatting citations and bibliographies. To select a style for
  your document:

      Page 244 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      1. If you have not already done so, open your document and the EndNote sidebar in Word Online.
         (See How to Cite While You Write in Word Online.)

      2. Click the button showing the currently selected style in the EndNote sidebar to see a list of favorite
         styles.




      3. Select your preferred style from the list or click Select another style to see a list of available styles.

      4. Enter the name, or part of the name, of the style you want in the Search field to see a list of styles
         that match your criteria.

      5. Select a style from the list.

      6. Click Apply Style. The new style will be applied and the citations and bibliography will automatically
         update.



Citations in Footnotes and Endnotes in Word Online
  To insert a citation into a footnote or endnote, follow the steps below to insert the footnote or endnote, then
  insert the EndNote citation into the footnote or endnote.

      1. If you have not already done so, open your document and the EndNote sidebar in Word Online.
         (See How to Cite While You Write in Word Online.)

      2. If you have chosen to keep references for specific documents in custom groups, set the custom
         group created for your document as the group to be searched. (See How to Cite While You Write in
         Word Online.)

      3. Position the cursor in the text where you would like to put the footnote or endnote citation.

      4. Select Insert Footnote from the References tab to create a footnote, or select Insert Endnote from
         the References tab to create an endnote.

      5. In the Search References field in the sidebar, enter a word or or set of words for the reference(s)
         you want to find. Keep these tips in mind when searching for references.

          a. Remember, you can search all your references or just the references within a specific group. If
             you have a large library, setting up a custom group for each document in advance with only the
             references used for that document will allow you to limit your search to the references for that
             document.

          b. If you use multiple search terms, by default you will expand the search rather than narrow it
             down. For example, the search parrot crow will find any reference with parrot or crow in it,
             not just the references that contain both terms. Here are methods for narrowing your search

                  find records that contain both terms in the same record, although they may not be in the
                  same field.
              (2) To find records that contain a phrase, put the phrase in double quotation marks. For
                  example, "grey parrot" will find only the records that include that phrase somewhere
                  in the record.
              (3) To omit records that contain a word, put a minus sign before any word that must not be in
                  the record. For example, +parrot -crow will find any records that include the word
                  parrot but exclude any records in that set of results that contain the word crow.

          c. If you need to find both singular and plural versions of a search term, or multiple terms with a
             common root, use an asterisk (*) at the end of the search term. For example, if you want to find
             both crow and crows, type crow* in the search field; for intelligent or intelligence, type
             intelli*. So, to add to the hints in b. above, to search for grey parrot or grey parrots as a
             phrase, type "grey parrot*" in the search field.

      6. Select the found references to insert in the document.

      7. Click the Insert Citation button at the bottom of the sidebar.

      8. When you have finished inserting citations, click the Update citations & bibliography button at the
         bottom of the sidebar to create or update your bibliography.


   Notes: In the instructions above, any words in the red Courier New font are search term example
   words.

   In Word Online footnotes and endnote do not appear at the bottom of the page or end of the document
   when editing documents; they only appear in the Reading view. Click on the View tab and select the
   Reading view to open a window where you can examine the footnotes in the document. When returning to
   editing view after using Reading View, you may need to refresh the web page to see your document.




Editing Citations in Word Online
  Sometimes citations require page numbers, prefix text, or suffix text. This is especially common with author-
  date formats, but may occasionally be needed for other formats, too. You can easily customize your citations
  to include these features, as well as to remove citations from the document, if needed.

  Citations cannot be edited by typing or deleting text inside the citation. Any such change would disappear
  the next time the citations were updated. All changes inside a citation must be made using the tools in the
  EndNote sidebar.

   Note: If multiple people are editing a shared document, Word Online controls whose changes are
   considered the "last saved," not EndNote.


      Page 246 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   There are two ways to open a citation for editing: 1) use the Manage citations button on the sidebar, or 2)
   click on the citation in the document to directly open that citation for editing.


Using the Manage Citations Button to Edit Citations

       1. If you have not already done so, open your document and the EndNote add-on in Word
          Online. (See How to Cite While You Write in Word Online.)

       2. After inserting your reference(s) and updating the citations and bibliography (see Inserting
          References in a Word Online Document), select Manage citations in the sidebar. The sidebar will
          update to show all the citations in your document. If you have grouped citations, citations with more
          than one reference in them, you may not see all references in the citation. Hover over the citation in
          the list to see the references in the grouped citation.

       3. To see the details on a citation and edit it, select the Edit citation ( ) button by a citation in the
          list. The references in the selected citation will be displayed similarly to the screenshot below. The
          Edit citation option is selected, and the following changes can be made to the citation.

                                                          styles that have a required sorting order for within
                                                          grouped citations, such as the APA style.

                                                          Note that spaces and punctuation must be
                                                          included.

          Note: If the author and year are excluded when using an author-date citation style, a citation will
          not appear in the document but the reference will appear in the bibliography. However, if the
          author and year are excluded in an author-date citation style but page numbers are included, only
          the page numbers will appear in the citation and the reference will appear in the bibliography.

Working with Shared Documents in Word Online
Working with Citations
   Documents in Word Online can be shared with other Word Online users, and those sharing the document
   with editing rights can add EndNote references from their own EndNote Web libraries. After a reference has
   been added, anyone with editing rights can edit the citation in the document. Keep these points in mind
   when working on shared documents.

       ▪ Multiple users can insert citations and the user can see the references added by other users, but
          there is no way to track which references were cited by whom.

       ▪ Those working on the document can only insert references from their own library. They will not have
          access to groups shared with them through EndNote online. To use references shared through
          EndNote online you must use the Word desktop application (see Using Cite While You Write with
          EndNote Online).

       ▪ When a user is editing or adding a citation and another user updates the document at the same time,
          Word Online controls which changes are saved, not EndNote.

       ▪ Citations must be edited using the EndNote sidebar. Any manual changes to the citations or
          bibliography will be overwritten when the citations are updated.

Adding References to an Existing Citation in a Shared Document

   To add a reference to an existing citation in the document without using Manage citations, place your cursor
   next to the existing citation, with no space between the cursor and the citation, and enter the reference as
   you normally would. The reference will be inserted next to the existing citation as a temporary citation and
   will be merged with it when the citations are updated (If there is a space between your reference and the
   existing citation, a new citation will be created instead of adding your reference to the existing citation.) (See
   Inserting References in a Word Online Document.)

   To add new references from your own library using Manage citations:

       1. With your document open in Word Online, click on the citation you want to add references to.

       2. Click the Add references button to see a list of references in your library.

       3. Select the references from the list to add to the selected citation. For information about searching
          for references and limiting the search to specific groups, see Inserting References in a Word Online
          Document.

       4. Click the Close button.

       5. Click the Update citations & bibliography button to update the citation(s) in your document.

Removing References from a Shared Document

   You can also remove references from an existing citation, even if they were added from another library. To
   remove a reference from a citation in the document, select the citation, then click the Remove reference
   (x) button in the Edit citations dialog, as shown below.




   To remove an entire citation from the document:

       1. Select the citation in the document.

       2. In the Edit citation dialog, click the Remove citation button (the small trash can   ) for the citation.

       3. A confirmation dialog will appear. To remove the citation, click OK. The citation will be removed from
          the document.

Editing References in an Existing Citation

   Other editing of references within an existing citation, such as adding page numbers, prefix text, or suffix
   text, is done just as if the references had come from your own library. See Editing Citations in Word Online
   for more information.

EndNote in PowerPoint
Introduction: Inserting Citations and References in
PowerPoint
  Use the commands at the top of the PowerPoint ribbon to easily and quickly insert citations and references
  in your PowerPoint slides. EndNote formats citations and references based on the rules defined for the
  selected output style.

  We recommend that you select a style from the Style menu before you begin inserting citations and
  references in your document. Please remember that selecting a new output style will not update the
  formatting of citations and references already inserted into the document.

  This feature is compatible with Microsoft PowerPoint versions 2010, 2013, 2016, 2019, or Office 365 (locally
  installed desktop version only).

  Insert Citation

     Select this option to search for and insert citations in your document. Selecting this option opens the
     Find & Insert My Citations dialog. When using this option, what is inserted will be formatted according to
     the Citation template in the output style.

  Insert Selected Citation(s)

     Select this option to insert citations selected from your open EndNote library. First, open EndNote and
     select the needed references. Return to your PowerPoint presentation and click this button. EndNote
     inserts the citation for the selected reference where you position your cursor. When using this option,
     what is inserted will be formatted according to the Citation template in the output style.

  Insert Reference

     Select this option to search for and insert bibliographic references in your document. Selecting this
     option opens the Find & Insert My References dialog. When using this option, what is inserted will be
     formatted according to the Bibliography template in the output style.

  Insert Selected Reference(s)

     Select this option to insert bibliographic references selected from your open EndNote library. First, open
     EndNote and select the needed references. Return to your PowerPoint presentation and click this
     button. EndNote inserts the selected references where you position your cursor. When using this
     option, what is inserted will be formatted according to the Bibliography template in the output style.

Output Styles in PowerPoint
  An output style determines how EndNote formats information in citations and references in your PowerPoint
  slides.

  We recommend that you select a style from the Style menu before you begin inserting citations and

  the EndNote Styles dialog. Each style you select from the dialog displays on the Style menu.


The Style Menu
  By default, the Style menu will show your "favorite" styles. This list starts with a small default set of styles
  and adds styles as you use them. To add or remove styles from this list, see Adding Styles to the Output
  Styles Menu.

  After citations or references are inserted, they are plain text. They do not contain field codes that can be
  updated as they do in Word. You can edit the citations to add page numbers, or remove the author or year.

Cite While You Write in Apache OpenOffice
Writer
  The instructions in this section apply to Apache OpenOffice Writer 3.x or 4.x, but can also be adapted for
  use with LibreOffice 4.x–7.x (32-bit).


Overview of the Cite While You Write Process
in OpenOffice Writer
  Use Cite While You Write (CWYW) with Apache OpenOffice Writer 3.x or 4.x to easily and quickly cite
  references and create a paper with properly formatted citations and a bibliography. Cite While You Write
  gives you access to EndNote references and formatting commands with an EndNote menu in Writer. See
  How to Cite While You Write with OpenOffice Writer.

  You can start by inserting a citation into the document. Then, you can format the citation and a bibliography
  according to any one of thousands of styles. See Finding and Inserting Citations in OpenOffice Writer.


Word Processor Compatibility for Apache OpenOffice
Writer
  You can Cite While You Write with Apache OpenOffice Writer 3.x or 4.x. Writer displays Cite While You
  Write commands on an EndNote menu.

  If you use Microsoft Word as your desktop word processor, see How to Cite While You Write with Microsoft
  Word.

  If you use a desktop word processor other than Microsoft Word or OpenOffice.org Writer, or an older version
  of these word processors, save your document as an RTF file and use Format Paper. See Basic Instructions
  for Using Format Paper.

  If you use Microsoft Word Online, see Cite While You Write in Word Online.

  If you use Google Docs, see Cite While You Write in Google Docs.

  To create a stand-alone bibliography that is not based on the citations in a paper, see Introduction to
  Independent Bibliographies.

   Note: Only one word processor at a time should be open when inserting citations and formatting
   documents.



Installing Cite While You Write Support for OpenOffice
Writer
  EndNote’s installation program installs Cite While You Write support for OpenOffice Writer. If you installed
  the OpenOffice suite after installing EndNote, you must either reinstall EndNote, or Repair or Modify your
  installation. For more information, see No EndNote Commands in Word or Writer.

      Page 259 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


  EndNote commands appear on an EndNote menu in OpenOffice.org Writer.


Cite While You Write Commands in OpenOffice Writer
  When Cite While You Write is installed, several EndNote commands appear on an EndNote menu in
  OpenOffice Writer.

  When you select an EndNote command from the menu, the EndNote program starts (if not already running).

  These are brief descriptions of the Cite While You Write commands found on the EndNote menu in
  OpenOffice Writer:

      ▪ Go To EndNote: Bring EndNote to the front of your screen. This command launches EndNote if it is
         not already running.

      ▪ Find Citation(s): Search for EndNote references to select and insert as citations in your OpenOffice
         Writer document. See Finding and Inserting Citations in OpenOffice Writer.

      ▪ Format Bibliography: Format (or reformat) your paper according to the rules of the selected style.
         The formatting process replaces the temporary citations in your paper with formatted citations, and
         builds a bibliography at the end of the document. See Customizing Bibliography Settings with
         OpenOffice Writer.

      ▪ Insert Selected Citations: Insert a citation for each reference currently selected in the open
         EndNote library. You can insert any number of consecutive in-text citations; however, attempting to
         insert hundreds of EndNote references at one time may cause a system slowdown or freezing. See
         Inserting Selected Citations in OpenOffice.

      ▪ Edit Citations: Edit existing individual or multiple citations. You can omit the author and/or year from
         citations, or add prefix or suffix text (such as page numbers) to citations. See Editing Citations in
         OpenOffice Writer.

      ▪ Unformat Citation(s): Unformat a selected citation before editing it, or unformat the whole
         document. This removes style formatting for the selected citations and leaves temporary citations,
         which usually consist of the author’s last name, the year, and the record number surrounded by
         delimiters. See Unformatting Citations in OpenOffice Writer.

      ▪ Cite While You Write Preferences: Change general Cite While You Write preferences. See Setting
         Cite While You Write Preferences in OpenOffice Writer.

      ▪ Help: Display help about Cite While You Write features.

   Note: Several Cite While You Write commands also appear on the Tools menu in EndNote. To use these
   commands from within EndNote, you must use at least one Cite While You Write command from within
   OpenOffice Writer during the current session.

  Troubleshooting: See No EndNote Commands in Word or Writer if commands do not appear in Word or
  Writer.


How to Cite While You Write with OpenOffice Writer
  The basic steps required to cite a reference and generate a bibliography with Writer are summarized below.


      Page 260 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


  To Cite While You Write:

     1. Open the EndNote library or libraries that contain the references you wish to cite.

     2. Start OpenOffice Writer and open the paper you are writing.

     3. When you are ready to cite a source, position the cursor in the text where you would like to put the
        citation.

     4. In OpenOffice Writer, go to the EndNote menu and select Find Citation(s). A Find Citations dialog
        appears, which shows the previous search results.

          Note: If this is the first time you have used the Find Citations dialog, it may be completely blank
          because there are no previous search results to display.

     5. In the Find box, enter identifying text for EndNote to locate the appropriate reference. This could be
        an author’s last name, a year, a keyword, or any other combination of terms found in the reference.

     6. Click Search and EndNote compares the identifying text to your EndNote references and then lists
        the matching reference(s).

     7. Identify, select, and Insert the appropriate reference(s).

     8. Go back to step 3 to insert the next citation, and continue citing references this way.

          Note: Each time you insert a citation it is instantly formatted, and a bibliography is updated at the
          end of your document. When you are done inserting citations, your document is done!

     9. If your citations are not automatically formatted, and a bibliography is not updated each time you
        insert a citation, go to the EndNote menu and select Format Bibliography.

         A Format Bibliography dialog appears, where you can change or verify the style and layout of the
         bibliography. (You can Format Bibliography at any time in order to change the style or layout of your
         citations and bibliography.)

          Note: The dialog lists the styles that are currently selected as your "favorites" in the Style
          Manager. If you need to choose a style that is not in the list, click Browse to locate it.

    10. Click OK. EndNote scans your paper and, using the selected style, formats any temporary citations,
        reformats formatted citations, and appends a bibliography to the end of your paper.

  Your paper is ready for publication!

Forms of Citations in OpenOffice Writer

   A "citation" is the brief bibliographic information in the body of a paper that refers the reader to a complete
   reference in the bibliography. A citation typically consists of a bibliography number or the author and year in
   parentheses:

       ... of the species at hand.1
       ... of the species at hand. (Argus, 1991)

   Citations can appear as either unformatted or formatted in your OpenOffice Writer document.

Unformatted (Temporary) Citations

   An unformatted citation is a temporary placeholder, and does not reflect final output. It will appear when you
   Unformat Citation(s) or manually enter unformatted citations. It contains information to find a unique,
   corresponding EndNote reference in the currently open library.

   An unformatted citation typically consists of the first author’s last name, year, and the EndNote record
   number, with citation delimiters at each end to identify the text:

       {Author, Year #Record Number}

   For example:

        {Alvarez, 1994 #8}

   EndNote relies on these temporary citations to determine which references to include in the bibliography.
   See Components of a Temporary Citation for more information on temporary/unformatted citations.

Formatted Citations

   The Format Bibliography command uses an EndNote output style to convert all unformatted citations into
   formatted citations, and reflects final output.

   Citations formatted in an Author-Date style might look like this:

       (Alvarez 2009; Strong 2010)

   This is the same citation formatted in the Numbered style:


       Page 262 of 631

       [1,2]

   Formatted citations include hidden information and should not be edited directly. See Editing Citations in
   OpenOffice Writer for information on safely editing formatted citations.

   You can easily revert from formatted citations to unformatted citations at any time. See Unformatting
   Citations in OpenOffice Writer.


Finding and Inserting Citations in OpenOffice Writer
   You can search for EndNote references and insert them without ever leaving OpenOffice Writer.

   This is the easiest way to find and insert a citation into an OpenOffice Writer document:

      1. Open the EndNote libraries that contain the references you wish to cite.

      2. Open the OpenOffice Writer document and position the cursor at the location where you would like
         the citation.

      3. From the EndNote menu, select Find Citation(s) to display the Find Citations dialog.

      4. In the Find text box, enter text to identify the reference you wish to cite. EndNote assumes an "and"
         between each word, and will search all fields in your records.

      5. Click Search and EndNote compares the text to text in your EndNote references and lists the
         matching reference(s).

      6. Identify and select your reference(s), and click Insert to insert the reference(s). If no references
         match your text, you need to modify your search text and click Search again.

   Citations are inserted into your paper in the same font as the surrounding text. Once a citation is inserted, it
   contains reference information in hidden codes.

   You can insert citations in an existing manuscript or as you write. Remember to save your document as you
   work.

   To format your citations and generate a bibliography, see Customizing Bibliography Settings with
   OpenOffice Writer.


Inserting Selected Citations in OpenOffice Writer
   To insert references selected in EndNote:

      1. Open the OpenOffice Writer document and position the cursor at the location where you would like
         the citation.

      2. Go to the EndNote menu and select Go to EndNote.

      3. Select the desired reference(s) in your EndNote library.

      4. Click the Insert Selected Citations button ( ) in EndNote, or switch back to the OpenOffice Writer
         document and select Insert Selected Citation(s) from the EndNote menu.

Finding and Inserting from Highlighted Text in OpenOffice Writer
   To find and insert a citation from highlighted text:

      1. As you are typing, enter text to identify the reference you wish to cite, and highlight that text.

      2. From the EndNote menu, select Find Citation(s) to display the Find Citations dialog.

   EndNote inserts your highlighted text into the Find box. To insert a citation, use the Find Citation(s) dialog as
   described in Finding and Inserting Citations in OpenOffice Writer.


Using Drag-and-Drop or Copy-and-Paste in OpenOffice Writer
   You can drag selected citations from your EndNote library and drop them into your paper at the desired
   location for the citation.

   You can also copy citations from the EndNote library and paste them into the document using Copy (Ctrl+C)
   from EndNote’s Edit menu and then Paste (Ctrl+V) from the OpenOffice Writer Edit menu.


Inserting Multiple Citations in OpenOffice Writer
   There are several ways to insert multiple references in one in-text citation. When formatted, they appear as
   one multiple citation, sorted as your bibliographic style requires:

       Unformatted: {Hall, 1988 #77; Baker, 1988 #16}
       Formatted: (Baker, 1988; Hall, 1988)

   You can insert any number of references into an in-text citation; however, attempting to insert hundreds of
   EndNote references at one time may cause a system slowdown or freezing.

    Note: If one of the citations in a multiple citation is not matched during formatting, the entire citation
    remains unformatted.

   To insert multiple references as a grouped citation from within OpenOffice Writer:

      1. Place your cursor where you want to enter the grouped citation.

      2. From the EndNote menu, select Find Citation(s).

      3. Enter a search term that will find the references you want, and click Search.

      4. Hold down the Ctrl key while clicking on the desired references in the list (or hold down the Shift key
         to select a continuous range of references) in order to select the references.

      5. Click Insert.

   To insert multiple selected citations from EndNote:

      1. In OpenOffice Writer, place your cursor where you want to insert a grouped citation.

      2. Select Go to EndNote from the EndNote menu.




       Page 264 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      3. In EndNote, hold down the Ctrl key while clicking on the desired references in your library (or hold
         down the Shift key to select a continuous range of references).

      4. Click the Insert Selected Citations button ( ) in EndNote, or switch back to the OpenOffice Writer
         document and select Insert Selected Citation(s) from the EndNote menu.

   To insert multiple citations individually:

   Another option is to insert citations individually, but immediately next to each other. Cite While You Write
   merges adjacent citations during formatting. Citations do not merge if any character separates them—
   including a space or punctuation mark.

       Unformatted: {Hall,1988 #77}{Baker, 1988 #16}
       Merged when Formatted: (Baker, 1988; Hall, 1988)

    Note: You can add citations to an existing in-text citation, or change the order of citations within the
    delimiters, with the Edit Citations dialog.

   To insert, remove, or edit citations within an existing in-text citation:

      1. Click on the formatted citation.

      2. In OpenOffice Writer, go to the EndNote menu and then Edit Citation(s) to display the EndNote Edit
         Citation dialog.

           All of the cited references in the document are listed in the left column of the dialog. Text showing
           above the citation shows the citation formatted according to the currently selected style. The box
           below shows details for the selected citation. To the right of the citations list are options for editing
           the selected citation.

      3. Select a citation, and then:

           ▪ Click Remove to delete it.

           ▪ Click Insert to insert another citation within the same set of delimiters.

           ▪ Use the arrow buttons to change the order of the citation in a grouped citation. (If a Citation Sort
              Order is applied by the current output style, changing the order of citations in a grouped citation
              has no effect.)

   You can use the other features on this dialog as described in Customizing Individual Citations with
   OpenOffice.


Inserting From Multiple Libraries in OpenOffice Writer
   You can cite references from multiple libraries. Simply open the selected libraries before you begin inserting
   citations.

   If possible, though, we recommend that you use a single library when writing a paper. Keeping all of your
   references in one library simplifies the writing process because you know exactly where to find each
   reference, there is little likelihood of duplicate references, and you only need to have one library open when
   inserting citations.




       Page 265 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


    Note: If you plan to insert citations from more than one library into a paper, read about the Merge
    Duplicates in Bibliography preference.


Customizing Individual Citations in OpenOffice Writer
   There may be cases where you want individual citations to differ from the standard format. You may want to
   remove the year or author from a citation if either was mentioned in the context of the sentence, or you
   might want to add a page reference or comment before or after the citation.

   For example, assume a formatted citation looks like this:

       Hall’s discovery (Hall, 1988)

   You can omit the author’s name from the citation:

       Hall’s discovery (1988)

   You can omit the date from the citation:

       the 1988 discovery (Hall)

   You can add a suffix with a page number to the citation:

       the discovery (Hall, 1988 p.4)

   You can add a prefix to the citation:

       the discovery (see Hall, 1988)

   To customize a formatted citation:

      1. Insert and format the citation.

      2. Click on the formatted citation.

      3. From the EndNote menu, select Edit Citation(s) to display the Edit Citation dialog.

          All of the cited references in the document are listed in the left column of the dialog. Text showing
          above the citation shows the citation formatted according to the currently selected style. The box
          below shows details for the selected citation. To the right of the citations list are options for editing
          the selected citation.

      4. Select the citation you want to customize.

      5. Customize as needed:

          Exclude Author: Select this to omit the author name from the formatted citation.

          Exclude Year: Select this to omit the date from the formatted citation.

          Prefix: Enter text here to print immediately before the citation text (spaces are significant).

          Suffix: Enter text here to print after the citation text (spaces are significant). You can enter page
          numbers here if you always want them to print after the citation, even when not using a style that
          includes the Cited Pages field. You can also use the Suffix field to include section numbers, verse

       Page 266 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


          lines (for poetry, for example), or any other information to indicate a specific location within the cited
          reference.

          Pages: Page numbers entered here are considered entered into a "Cited Pages" field, so they can
          be manipulated on output just like any other EndNote field. In order to print, the Cited Pages field
          must be included in the citation template and/or footnote template of your output style. This is
          typically used to print the page numbers within a full footnote citation. Most EndNote styles that
          require a special format for citations in footnotes are already configured this way. You can modify the
          Citation Template in your output style to include Cited Pages.

          Insert…: Select this option to search for and insert additional references to the selected citation, to
          create or expand a grouped citation.

          Remove: Select this option to remove the citation from the document.

      6. Click OK to implement the change(s) to the citation.


Inserting Citations into a Formatted Paper in OpenOffice Writer
   Most citations can simply be inserted using the EndNote menu, then the Find Citation(s) command, as
   described in Finding and Inserting Citations in OpenOffice Writer. However, when adding new references to
   an existing formatted citation, it is important to insert the new citation adjacent to the existing citation.

   To add a new reference to an existing citation, insert the new reference next to (not within) the existing
   citation, like this:

       (Hockney and Ellis, 1996){Argus, 1984 #1}

   Adjacent citations are merged during formatting, and the formatted citations are sorted according to the
   style:

       (Argus, 1984; Hockney and Ellis, 1996)

    Note: Do not insert a citation into the middle of a formatted citation. Insert it immediately before or after
    the existing citation, with no space between them.

   Another option is to use the Insert button in the Edit Citation dialog:

      1. In OpenOffice Writer, select the citation you wish to add a reference to.

      2. From the EndNote menu, select Edit Citation(s) to open the Edit Citation dialog.

      3. Make sure the citation you want to add a reference to is selected, then click the Insert… button to
         open the Find Citation(s) dialog.

      4. Search for the new citation, select it, and click the Insert button to add it to the original citation. You
         will be returned to the Edit Citation dialog and will see the new reference selected in the list.

      5. Click OK to save your changes.


Citing References in Footnotes and Endnotes in OpenOffice Writer
   Once you have created a footnote or endnote in OpenOffice Writer, you can cite references in that footnote
   or endnote just like you cite them in the body of the document.

       Page 267 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   To cite a reference in a footnote or endnote:

      1. Use the appropriate command in OpenOffice Writer to create the footnote or endnote. (EndNote
         does not create the footnote or endnote in the document, but is used to insert and format citations in
         the note.)

      2. Position the cursor in the footnote or endnote where you would like the citation(s) to appear.

      3. Insert the citation as you normally would.

   The EndNote style that is selected when you choose Format Bibliography determines how citations in
   footnotes and endnotes are formatted. EndNote can format these citations as brief in-text citations or like
   complete references in the bibliography. It can also create a special format specific to footnotes or endnotes,
   including options like "Ibid." and other variations of shortened references when a citation appears more than
   once in the footnotes or endnotes. See Bibliography and Footnote Templates.

   If you are citing full references in footnotes, you can include specific page numbers to be formatted like a
   regular EndNote field. See Customizing Individual Citations with OpenOffice. Or, if you are manually typing
   citations, see Components of a Temporary Citation; the method for adding page numbers to temporary
   citations works the same way in Word, OpenOffice Writer, and when using Format Paper with Rich Text
   Format (RTF) documents..


Typing Citations into Your Paper in OpenOffice Writer
   Manually entering citations is the same whether you are using Cite While You Write with
   OpenOffice Writer, Cite While You Write with Microsoft Word, or Format Paper with a Rich Text
   Format (RTF) file. See these topics:

       ▪ Notes About Temporary Citations

Editing Citations in OpenOffice Writer
   Once you have inserted and formatted a citation, you should not edit it directly (although you can do so, if
   you feel you must). Direct edits are lost the next time EndNote formats the bibliography.

   You can almost always get EndNote to format your citations exactly to your specifications by editing the
   style, the EndNote reference, or the citation, as described below. Changes made following these instructions
   will remain after reformatting.

   To safely edit a formatted citation:

      1. Click on the citation you wish to change.

      2. From the EndNote menu, select Edit Citation(s) to display the Edit Citation dialog. All of the cited
         references in the document are listed in the left column of the dialog. Text showing above the
         citation shows the citation formatted according to the currently selected style. The box below shows
         details for the selected citation. To the right of the citations list are options for editing the selected
         citation.

      3. Select the appropriate citation from the list at the left of the dialog (you can scroll through all citations
         in the document) and make any of the following changes to the highlighted citation:

          Exclude Author: Select this to omit the author name from the formatted citation.

          Exclude Year: Select this to omit the date from the formatted citation.

          Prefix: Enter text here to print immediately before the citation text (spaces are significant).

          Suffix: Enter text here to print after the citation text (spaces are significant).

          Pages: Enter page numbers here to appear as Cited Pages. To appear, the Cited Pages field must
          be included in the citation template or footnote template of the output style.

      4. You can add or remove citations from a grouped citation, or change the order of citations.

          Insert: Use this to add another citation within the same set of delimiters.

          Remove: Highlight a citation and click Remove to delete it from the in-text citation.

          Up and Down Arrows: Highlight a reference and use the arrows to change the order of display. (If
          a Citation Sort Order is applied by the current output style, using this dialog to change the order of
          citations in a grouped citation has no effect.)

      5. Click OK to implement your change(s).

   After making changes, select Format Bibliography to reformat the new or modified citations and regenerate
   the bibliography.


Unformatting Citations in OpenOffice Writer
   Unformatting reverts formatted citations to temporary citations and removes the bibliography.

   If your citations are formatted in a numbered style, you can unformat your paper to easily identify citations
   as you work. You can use Format Bibliography again later to restore the formatted citations. See
   Customizing Bibliography Settings with OpenOffice Writer.

       Page 269 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


    Note: You must have the corresponding EndNote library, or libraries, open in order to format the paper
    again.

   To unformat citations:

      1. Determine which citations you want to unformat:

           ▪ To unformat a particular citation, highlight only that citation.

           ▪ If the citation you want to unformat is part of a grouped citation, highlight the grouped citation. All
              citations within the delimiters will be unformatted. Be sure to select the entire citation.

           ▪ To unformat a section of the document, highlight that section.

           ▪ To unformat the entire document, either select nothing or select the entire document.
      2. From the EndNote menu, select Unformat Citation(s). If you are unformatting the entire document,
         this unformats all of the in-text citations and removes the current bibliography.

   You can tell when a paper is unformatted because the citations appear in the temporary citation format
   (such as {Smith, 1999 #25}).

   Unformatted citations are temporary placeholders that do not reflect final output. You can format the paper
   again at any time if you have the library, or libraries, that the citations were originally inserted from.

    Note: To format your paper again, go the EndNote menu and select Format Bibliography.


Moving or Copying Citations in OpenOffice Writer
   You can highlight any text that includes citations, Cut or Copy it, and then Paste it elsewhere in the
   document. You can do this with formatted or temporary (unformatted) citations.

   To move or copy only the citation itself, make sure you highlight the entire citation (including any
   surrounding delimiters) as well as an extra character before and after the citation. Including the characters
   before and after the citation ensures that you include the hidden bookmark associated with the citation. (If
   the hidden bookmark is not part of the selection, you will copy plain text, and not an EndNote citation.) Then
   Cut (Ctrl+X) or Copy (Ctrl+C), and Paste (Ctrl+V) the citation elsewhere in the document.


Deleting Citations in OpenOffice Writer
   To delete an unformatted citation, highlight the entire citation (including delimiters), and press the
   Backspace or Delete key.

   While it is possible to highlight a formatted citation and press the Delete key on your keyboard, we do not
   recommend you do that. If you do not completely delete the citation and its associated bookmark, you could
   corrupt your document.

   To safely delete a formatted citation:

      1. In OpenOffice Writer, highlight the citation you want to delete.

      2. From the EndNote menu, select Edit Citation(s) to display the EndNote Edit Citation dialog.


       Page 270 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      3. In the left column, make sure the highlighted citation is the one you want to delete. If the citation is
         part of a grouped citation, make sure you select just the citation you want to delete.

      4. Click Remove.

      5. Click OK.


Generating Bibliographies
Generating Bibliographies in OpenOffice Writer
   Formatting a bibliography serves two functions:

       ▪ It formats each in-text citation according to the selected bibliographic style.

       ▪ It adds a complete bibliography to the document (unless you override this with a setting in the output
          style).

   The format used for citations and references is determined by the output style selected.

   You can format the paper and generate a bibliography at any time after inserting at least one reference. This
   can be done in one of these ways:

       ▪ Instant Formatting actually works as you insert citations, and is enabled when you first start using
          Cite While You Write. EndNote uses the currently selected style to format citations and update the
          bibliography each time a citation is inserted. However, if you want to change the style or layout of
          references, you can use the Format Bibliography command to make changes manually.

       ▪ Format Bibliography allows you to modify bibliography preferences such as style and layout before
          formatting your document. From the EndNote menu, select Format Bibliography.

   These are the basic formatting instructions:

      1. In OpenOffice Writer, go to the EndNote menu and select Format Bibliography.

      2. On the Format Bibliography tab, use the With output style option to select an output style to format
         references.

      3. Click OK to format all citations and build the bibliography.

   To customize the Format Bibliography settings, see Customizing Bibliography Settings with OpenOffice
   Writer.


Customizing Bibliography Settings in OpenOffice Writer
   You may be halfway through inserting citations, or you may have finished writing your paper. As long as you
   have citations entered in your document, you can format your paper at any time. You can reformat after
   adding more citations, or to change the style or layout settings.

    Note: Each time a citation is formatted, the corresponding EndNote library must be open.

   To format citations and generate a bibliography:


       Page 271 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      1. In OpenOffice Writer, go to the EndNote menu and select Format Bibliography.

      2. On the Format Bibliography tab, change or verify these settings

          With output style: Select the appropriate output style to format references. You can experiment by
          reformatting with various output styles. To select a style not on the list, click the Browse button. To
          add more output styles to the list, see Adding Styles to the Output Styles Menu. To install more
          EndNote styles, see Installing Additional Output Styles.

          Temporary citation delimiters: These are the opening and closing delimiters for temporary
          citations. Make sure they are unique delimiters, and not characters you would normally use in your
          paper. The defaults are curly braces.

      3. On the Layout tab, change or verify these settings:

          Font and Size: These are the text font and size used for the bibliography.

          Bibliography title: To print a title at the top of your bibliography, type the title in this text box. It will
          always be centered; if you do not want it centered, leave this blank and use OpenOffice Writer to
          insert a title above the bibliography.

          Text Format: Highlight the bibliography title text and then use the Text Format button to display a
          dialog where you can change the font format of the highlighted text.

          Start with bibliography number: Enter a number if you want the starting number for a numbered
          bibliography to be something other than the default.

      4. Click OK to save the changes and format your citations and bibliography.

    Note: You do not have to verify each tab every time you format. If all you want to do is change the output
    style, select Format Bibliography, select the output style on the Format Bibliography tab, and click OK.


Reformatting Papers in OpenOffice Writer

Adding New Citations to Formatted Papers

   If you add more citations to your paper after the formatting process, you can update the citations and the
   bibliography by selecting the Format Bibliography command again.

    Note: You do not need to unformat your citations in order to reformat them.


Reformatting with Different Styles

   To reformat your paper in a different style:

      1. In OpenOffice Writer, go to the EndNote menu and select Format Bibliography.

      2. Select a new style from the Format Bibliography dialog and click OK.

   Your citations and bibliography are updated for the new bibliographic style. See Adding Styles to the Output

Directly Editing Bibliographies in OpenOffice Writer
   It is always best to make changes to your final bibliography by correcting the data in the EndNote library,
   editing the output style you are using, or adding or deleting citations from your paper. Then, after making the
   necessary changes, format the bibliography to automatically make the corrections.

   It is not always possible for EndNote to format the bibliography exactly as needed, so you might need to
   manually edit the formatted bibliography. If you must do this, remember that if you reformat a paper after
   editing the bibliography, EndNote will not preserve your edits. When EndNote reformats a bibliography, it
   deletes the existing one and puts a new one in its place.

   You can edit the bibliography as you would any text. If you later reformat the paper, your edits will be gone.

   See Modifying Style Templates for more information.


Deleting Bibliographies in OpenOffice Writer
   To delete a bibliography, select the bibliography and then delete it.

   Make sure you drag the cursor from the line above the bibliography to the end of the bibliography in order to
   select the entire bibliography bookmark, or use the Navigator to select the EndNote Bibliography bookmark
   and delete it. Press the Backspace or Delete key.


Setting Cite While You Write Preferences in OpenOffice

Editing a Reference in the Library with OpenOffice Writer
   You may insert a citation into an OpenOffice Writer document, and then later edit the corresponding
   reference in EndNote. Are those changes reflected in your Writer document?

   Your citations and bibliography will reflect the edits the next time you reformat the paper with the EndNote
   library open. Open your document, open your EndNote library, and select Format Bibliography from the
   EndNote menu in OpenOffice Writer. EndNote will not be able to make the update if the library is not open
   during formatting.


Deleting a Reference from the Library with OpenOffice Writer
   The first time a citation is formatted, EndNote uses information from the unformatted citation to look in the
   open library and find the corresponding reference. If you later reformat, EndNote again looks in the library
   for that reference.

   If you have deleted the corresponding reference from the EndNote library and unformatted the citations,
   EndNote will not be able to find the reference information for formatting.

   If you add the reference to the library again, it will be assigned a different record number. You would need to
   reinsert the citation with OpenOffice Writer.

Record Numbers

   EndNote assigns a unique record number to each reference as it is added to your library. These record
   numbers appear in temporary citations to ensure that the correct reference is used when the paper is
   formatted:

       {Argus, 1991 #11}

   See Components of a Temporary Citation and Record Numbers for more information on record numbers in
   temporary citations.

   The record number for a reference is also visible in the title bar of the Reference panel.

   Note that:

       ▪ EndNote automatically assigns a record number sequentially to each reference as it is added to a
          library.

       ▪ If the same reference appears in two different libraries, the record numbers will most likely be
          different.

       ▪ If the same reference appears in two synced libraries or a library shared through EndNote Sync, the
          record numbers will most likely be different. This is because as the references are synced to the
          copy of the library on the new computer, they will be assigned new record numbers.

       ▪ Record numbers are never reused or reassigned within a library. When you delete a reference, the
          corresponding record number is never used again in that library.

       ▪ You cannot modify or reassign record numbers.




       Page 274 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       ▪ We recommend that you not rely on EndNote’s record numbers as a means of filing or numbering
          your office reprints, because you have no control over this number. Instead, enter your own unique
          number into the Label field, and use that number for your reprints.



Sharing Your OpenOffice Writer Documents
   You can directly share your OpenOffice (ODT) files with colleagues.

   If you want to convert your document for use with a previous version of Writer or a different word processor,
   you should Unformat Citations before saving in the different file format. Then, you may be able to reformat.
   The corresponding EndNote library (or libraries) must be available in order to reformat.

   Of course, if you just want to print a copy of the paper for someone, you do not need to do anything to your
   document other than print it!


Working on Different Computers with OpenOffice Writer
   It is possible to use references from an EndNote library a colleague has shared with you through EndNote
   Sync, or with a synced copy of your own EndNote library on different computers, and more than one library
   can be open and be searched for citations at the same time. A copy of the library citation data OpenOffice
   Writer document, so you can continue to add references and format the bibliography without the original
   libraries being open, so long as the citations are formatted. If you unformat the citations, you will need to
   have copies of the original libraries the citations were inserted from to reformat the bibliography.

   If you are inserting citations on only one machine, it is fine to move the document itself to other machines—
   as long as you will be accessing the document with the same version of Writer.


Saving Files for Other Versions of Writer and Other Word Processors
   If you open your document with a different version of Writer, or use the Save As command to save a
   formatted copy of your paper in another format, you may lose the ability to format citations in that document.

   If you plan to use your document with a different word processor or a different version of OpenOffice Writer,
   you should Unformat Citations before converting the document to the other file format.

   Unformatted citations are regular text; however, they are temporary placeholders that do not reflect final
   output. See Unformatting Citations in OpenOffice Writer.

   You can unformat citations and then save the document as a Microsoft Word file, as an older version Writer
   ODT file, or as an RTF file. For Word files, see How to Cite While You Write with Microsoft Word to reformat
   the paper. For older ODT files or RTF files, see Basic Instructions for Using Format Paper to format citations
   from these placeholders. You will need the original library, or libraries, the references were inserted from to
   reformat the paper.


Moving Documents between Microsoft Word and Writer
   You can convert your Microsoft Word documents to OpenOffice Writer documents, and vice versa. Always
   start by making a backup of the original document!

   With the original word processor, make sure you first unformat citations, then save the document, and then
   close the word processor. Then, open the file with the other word processor. You must have the associated
   EndNote library available and open in order to format the citations and bibliography.

Note: If you have both Microsoft Word and OpenOffice Writer open, the Cite While You Write commands
available within EndNote are active for the word processor that was launched first.

There are several Cite While You Write functions that are available only in Microsoft Word, and not in
OpenOffice Writer. These include:

    ▪ Inserting notes. See Including Notes in the List of References in Word.

    ▪ Inserting figures and tables. See Finding and Inserting Figures and Tables in Word.

    ▪ Constant background instant formatting. See Instant Formatting in Word.

    ▪ Creating multiple bibliographies in a single document with sections. See Creating Multiple
      Bibliographies in a Single Document.

    ▪ Using a Traveling Library (although the OpenOffice Writer file stores a copy of the data for use in
      formatting, it does not have all the features available in Word's traveling library, such as the ability to
      export the document library to EndNote). See The Traveling Library in Word.

Inserting References in a Google Docs Document
  To insert citations in the document, search for them in your library, then insert them in the document
  following the steps below.

  If you have not already done so, open your document and the EndNote extension in Google Docs. (See
  How to Cite While You Write in Google Docs.)

      1. If you have chosen to keep references for specific documents in custom groups, set the custom
         group created for your document as the group to be searched. (See How to Cite While You Write in
         Google Docs.)

      2. Position the cursor in the text where you would like to put the citation.

      3. In the Search References field in the sidebar, enter a word or or set of words for the reference(s)
         you want to find. Keep these tips in mind when searching for references.

          a. Remember, you can search all your references or just the references within a specific group. If
             you have a large library, setting up a custom group for each document in advance with only the
             references used for that document will allow you to limit your search to the references for that
             document.

          b. If you use multiple search terms, by default you will expand the search rather than narrow it
             down. For example, the search parrot crow will find any reference with parrot or crow in it,
             not just the references that contain both terms. Here are methods for narrowing your search
             results:
              (1) To create a search expression equivalent to "text AND text," add a plus sign before any
                  word that must be in the record you are looking for. For example, +parrot +crow will
                  find records that contain both terms in the same record, although they may not be in the
                  same field.
              (2) To find records that contain a phrase, put the phrase in double quotation marks. For
                  example, "grey parrot" will find only the records that include that phrase somewhere
                  in the record.
              (3) To omit records that contain a word, put a minus sign before any word that must not be in
                  the record. For example, +parrot -crow will find any records that include the word
                  parrot but exclude any records in that set of results that contain the word crow.

          c. If you need to find both singular and plural versions of a search term, or multiple terms with a
             common root, use an asterisk (*) at the end of the search term. For example, if you want to find
             both crow and crows, type crow* in the search field; for intelligent or intelligence, type
             intelli*. So, to add to the hints in b. above, to search for grey parrot or grey parrots as a
             phrase, type "grey parrot*" in the search field.

      4. Select the found references to insert in the document.

      5. Click the Insert Citation button at the bottom of the sidebar.

      6. When you have finished inserting citations, click the Update Citations button at the bottom of the
         sidebar to create or update your bibliography.

   Note: In the instructions above, any words in the red font are search term example words.



Selecting an EndNote Style in Google Docs
  EndNote includes over 7,500 reference styles for formatting citations and bibliographies. To select a
  different style for your document—

      1. If you have not already done so, open your document and the EndNote extension in Google Docs.
         (See How to Cite While You Write in Google Docs.)

      2. Click the Menu button in the EndNote sidebar, the button with three lines.




      3. Select Citation Style from the list. You will see a short list of favorite styles.

      4. Select Select another style to see a list of all available styles.

      5. Enter the name, or part of the name, of the style you want in the Search field to see a list of styles
         that match your criteria.

      6. Select a style from the list.

      7. Click Apply Style. The new style will be applied and the citations and bibliography will automatically
         update.


Citations in Footnotes in Google Docs
  To insert a citation into a footnote, follow the steps below to insert the footnote, then insert the EndNote
  citation into the footnote.

      1. If you have not already done so, open your document and the EndNote extension in Google Docs.
         (See How to Cite While You Write in Google Docs.)

      2. If you have chosen to keep references for specific documents in custom groups, set the custom
         group created for your document as the group to be searched. (See How to Cite While You Write in
         Google Docs.)

      3. Position the cursor in the text where you would like to put the citation.

      4. Select Insert, then Footnote from the Google Docs menu to create a footnote.

      5. In the Search References field in the sidebar, enter a word or or set of words for the reference(s)
         you want to find. Keep these tips in mind when searching for references.

          a. Remember, you can search all your references or just the references within a specific group. If
             you have a large library, setting up a custom group for each document in advance with only the

              references used for that document will allow you to limit your search to the references for that
              document.

          b. If you use multiple search terms, by default you will expand the search rather than narrow it
             down. For example, the search parrot crow will find any reference with parrot or crow in it,

              (2) To find records that contain a phrase, put the phrase in double quotation marks. For
                  example, "grey parrot" will find only the records that include that phrase somewhere
                  in the record.

         sidebar to create or update your bibliography.


   Note: In the instructions above, any words in the red font are search term example words.



Editing Citations in Google Docs
  Sometimes citations require page numbers, prefix text, or suffix text. This is especially common with author-
  date formats, but may occasionally be needed for other formats, too. You can easily customize your citations
  to include these features through Manage citations.

  Citations cannot be edited by typing or deleting text inside the citation. Any such change would disappear
  the next time the citations were updated. All changes inside a citation must be made using the tools in the
  EndNote sidebar. Also, citations cannot be cut-and-pasted or copied-and-pasted within the document. All
  citations must be inserted using the EndNote sidebar.

   Note: If multiple people are editing a shared document, Google Docs controls whose changes are
   considered the "last saved," not EndNote.

1. If you have not already done so, open your document and the EndNote extension in Google
   Docs. (See How to Cite While You Write in Google Docs.)

2. After inserting your reference(s) and updating the citations and bibliography (see Inserting
   References in a Google Docs Document), select Manage citations in the sidebar. The sidebar will
   update to show all the citations in your document. If you have grouped citations, citations with more
   than one reference in them, you may not see all references in the citation. Hover over the citation in
   the list to see the references in the grouped citation.

3. To see the details on a citation and edit it, select the Edit citation ( ) button by a citation in the list,
   then select Citation editor. The references in the selected citation will be displayed. Below them will
   be a list of the references in your custom group if you have selected a custom group, or your library
   if you have not selected a custom group, with the references used in your citation selected. Here
   you can add references to your grouped citation by selecting them or remove references from a
   grouped citation by unselecting them.

4. To make changes to a specific reference within the citation, select the More button to the right of the
   reference, then select Edit. (You can also select Remove as an alternate method of removing a
   reference from the citation.)




5. In this window you can add page numbers, prefix text, suffix text, or exclude the author's name or
   the year from the citation. The prefix will be immediately before the beginning of the reference and
   the suffix will be immediately after it; any spacing and punctuation you require will need to be typed
   in manually.

    Select the arrow ( or ) button to move between references in the citation if you wish to make
    changes to other references in the grouped citation. When you have finished making changes to the
    individual reference(s), click the Save button.

Working with Shared Documents in Google Docs
Working with Citations
   Documents in Google Docs can be shared with other Google Docs users and those sharing the document
   with editing rights can add EndNote references from their own EndNote libraries. After a reference has been
   added, anyone with editing rights can edit the citations in the document. Keep these points in mind when
   working on shared documents.

       ▪ Multiple users can insert citations and the user can see the references added by other users but
          there is no way to track which references were cited by whom.

       ▪ Those working on the document can only insert references from their own library. They will not have
          access to groups shared with them through EndNote Web.

       ▪ When a user is editing or adding a citation and another user updates the document at the same time,
          Google Docs controls which change is saved, not EndNote.

       ▪ Citations must be edited using the EndNote sidebar. Any manual changes to the citations or
          bibliography will be overwritten when the citations are updated.

Adding References to an Existing Citation

   There are two ways to add new references from your own library to an existing citation, even one that
   contains references from another library.



       Page 285 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       1. Place your cursor next to the existing citation, with no space between the cursor and the citation,
          and enter the reference as you normally would. The reference will be inserted next to the existing
          citation as a temporary citation and will be merged with it when the citations are updated (If there is
          a space between your reference and the existing citation, a new citation will be created instead of
          adding your reference to the existing citation.) (See Inserting References in a Google Docs
          Document.)

       2. Use the Manage citations feature to add the new reference to the citation.

           a. Select Manage citations in the sidebar. The sidebar will update to show all the citations in the
              document. For grouped citations, citations with more than one reference in them, you will only
              see information for the first reference in the list. Hover over the citation in the list to see all the
              references in the grouped citation.

           b. To see the details on a citation and edit it, including adding references to it, click the Edit citation
              ( ) button by a citation in the list, then Citation editor. The references in the selected citation
              will be displayed. Below them will be a list of the references from your library (in your custom
              group if you have chosen to show a custom group, or all the references in your library if you
              have not selected a custom group). The references that came from your library and are used in
              that citation will be selected. You will not see references listed that came from other libraries.
              Here you can add references from your library to the grouped citation by selecting them or
              remove references from your library from a grouped citation by unselecting them.

           c. Click the Save button at the bottom of the sidebar to save all the changes made to the citation
              and return to Manage citations.

           d. Click Update Citations to update the document.

Removing References from an Existing Citation

   You can also remove references from an existing citation, even if they were added from another library,
   using the Manage citations feature.

       1. To remove a reference from a citation.

           a. Select Manage citations in the sidebar. The sidebar will update to show all the citations in the
              document. For grouped citations, citations with more than one reference in them, you will only
              see information for the first reference in the list. Hover over the citation in the list to see all the
              references in the grouped citation.

           b. To remove a reference from a citation, click the Edit citation ( ) button by a citation in the list,
              then select Citation editor. The references in the selected citation will be displayed. Below them
              will be a list of the references from your library (in your custom group if you have chosen to
              show a custom group, or all the references in your library if you have not selected a custom
              group). The references that came from your library and are used in that citation will be selected.
              You will not see references listed that came from other libraries.

           c. To remove a specific reference within the citation that did not come from your library, select the
              More button to the right of the reference, then select Remove to remove the reference from the
              citation.

           d. Click the Save button at the bottom of the sidebar to save all the changes made to the citation
              and return to Manage citations.

           e. Click Update Citations to update the document.

Editing References in an Existing Citation

   Other editing of references within an existing citation, such as adding page numbers, prefix text, or suffix
   text, is done just as if the references had come from your own library. See Editing Citations in Google Docs
   for more information.


The Shared Document Window
   Google Docs documents with EndNote citations can be shared with other Google Docs users. If they also
   have EndNote 21 or later, they can also add citations from their library and edit citations in the document
   (see Working with Shared Documents in Google Docs). Everyone sharing the document can also pull
   references from the document into their own EndNote library.

   Along with the tools available through the EndNote sidebar, there are tools available through pop-ups in the
   document itself: The Citation Link pop-up and the Bibliography Link pop-up.

The Citation Link Pop-Up

   When you click in a citation in the text of the document, a small pop-up window will appear, as shown below.




   Clicking on the URL will reveal a synopsis like the one below, with the basic bibliographic information about
   the reference, even if the reference was inserted in the document by someone else sharing the document.
   Click Save to my library if you wish to add the reference to your library.




   The three buttons to the right of the URL provide the features below.


       Page 287 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       ▪ The Copy link     button will copy the URL to the clipboard.

       ▪ The Edit link    button will allow you to edit the URL for the link.

       ▪ The Remove link      button will remove all EndNote codes from the citation, leaving it as plain text in
          Google Docs. If the citation is a grouped citation, with multiple references in it, the codes will be
          removed for all references in the citation, not just the one you clicked on. Citations with codes
          removed can no longer be updated and will not appear in the bibliography when it is updated.

The Bibliography Link Pop-Up

   The Bibliography Link Pop-Up has very similar features to the Citation Link Pop-Up. One significant
   difference is that the URL will take you to your EndNote Web library if you are already logged in, or to the
   logon screen if you are not logged in.

   The three buttons to the right of the URL provide the features below.

       ▪ The Copy link     button will copy the EndNote Web URL to the clipboard.

       ▪ The Edit link    button will allow you to edit the URL for the link.

       ▪ The Remove link         button will remove the EndNote codes for that reference in the bibliography,
          converting it to plain text. However, if the citations are updated to create a new bibliography, the
          codes for all the references will be regenerated for the entire bibliography, including the reference
          you had previously removed the codes from.

Format Paper
Word Processor Compatibility for Format Paper
  You can create formatted citations and bibliographies for your papers without using Cite While You
  Write. Use Format Paper to cite references and create bibliographies for documents that can be saved as
  Rich Text Format (RTF) (see Basic Instructions for Using Format Paper). Word processors that can create
  RTF documents, include:

      ▪ Microsoft Word

      ▪ OpenOffice Writer

      ▪ LibreOffice Writer

      ▪ Scrivener®

      ▪ WordPerfect®

      ▪ And almost any other application that can save as RTF (Rich Text Format)

   Note: EndNote uses Unicode to appropriately display diacritics and other extended characters. If these
   characters do not display correctly when you format EndNote citations and references in your document,
   it may be because your word processor lacks Unicode support. Please refer to your word processor's
   documentation.

  To format references and create a bibliography (Cite While You Write) with Microsoft Word , see How to Cite
  While You Write with Microsoft Word.

  To format references and create a bibliography (Cite While You Write) with OpenOffice.org Writer, see How
  to Cite While You Write with OpenOffice Writer.

  To format references and create a bibliography (Cite While You Write) with Microsoft Word Online, see Cite
  While You Write in Word Online.

  To format references and create a bibliography (Cite While You Write) with Google Docs, see Cite While You
  Write in Google Docs.

  While you can use the Format Paper feature to format Word files saved as RTF or OpenOffice documents
  with the extension ODT, it is much easier and more efficient to use Cite While You Write.

  To create a stand-alone bibliography that is not based on the citations in a paper, see Introduction to
  Independent Bibliographies.

Basic Instructions for Using Format Paper
  This topic describes how to create formatted citations and bibliographies for your papers without using Cite
  While You Write for Microsoft Word or OpenOffice Writer.


      Page 289 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   The basic steps are covered here. More details about how to switch between programs and various tips for
   citing references are described in the sections following these basic instructions.

   Citing references is a straightforward process of copying temporary citations from EndNote and pasting
   them into your word-processing document. While writing a paper in your word processor, you can have
   EndNote running in the background so that it’s easy to switch between the two programs when you need to
   cite a source. Although you can enter the EndNote temporary citations into a paper at any time, most writers
   find it convenient to enter the citations as they are writing the paper instead of waiting to insert them after
   the text is written.

    Note: The Format Paper command works on Rich Text Format (RTF) documents or OpenOffice Writer
    (ODT) documents. See Word Processor Compatibility for Format Paper. You create your paper and insert
    citations with your word processor. You can scan OpenOffice Writer documents directly. When you are
    ready to scan and format citations for other document types, you must first save a copy of your paper as
    RTF, and then scan that copy of the paper.

    Cite While You Write is available for OpenOffice Writer 3.x or 4.x documents. See Overview of the Cite
    While You Write Process in OpenOffice Writer

   To practice using the Format Paper feature, you can follow this procedure using one of the example
   documents found in the EndNote C:\Users\Public\Documents\EndNote\Examples folder. We recommend
   experimenting with the Sample_RichText.RTF or Sample_OpenDocType.ODT file.


Citing References in a Paper
   To cite a reference in a paper:

      1. Start your word processor and open the paper you are writing. As an example, you can locate and
         open Sample_RichText.RTF found in the C:\Users\Public\Documents\EndNote\Examples folder. If
         you use OpenOffice Writer, you can use Sample_OpenDocType.ODT as an example.

      2. When you are ready to cite a source, position the cursor in the text where you would like to put the
         citation.

              …a commonly documented phenomena |.

      3. Start EndNote and open your library, or libraries, (if not already open). See Opening a Library if you
         need help with this step.

      4. Select the reference(s) in your EndNote library that you want to cite. Press the Ctrl key while clicking
         on the references to select multiple references; press the Shift key to select a range of references.

      5. Select Copy (Ctrl+C) from the Edit menu, then return to your word processor and Paste (Ctrl+V) the
         temporary citation into the text of your document, or drag-and-drop the selected citations from
         EndNote into your paper. The pasted citation appears in EndNote’s temporary format: first author’s
         last name, year of publication, and record number, all enclosed in curly braces:

             {Wiegrebe, 2008 #60}

          If multiple references were selected, their citations appear together within one set of delimiters in the
          order in which they are listed in the Library window.

             {Wiegrebe, 2008 #60;Gorresen, 2018 #2469}




       Page 290 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   This citation is not the final citation, but rather a temporary citation that will be formatted later. The number in
   the temporary citation is not a bibliography number but a unique record number. When you format this
   paper, EndNote builds a bibliography based on the temporary citations that it finds in the paper, and
   reformats them according to the selected style.

   Continue following steps 2-5 to insert citations as you write your paper.


Formatting the Citations and Bibliography
   To save your document:

      1. When you have finished adding citations, save the changes to your document.

      2. If the file you created is not an OpenOffice Writer document or an RTF document, save a copy of the
         file as RTF. From the File menu, select Save As. In the file dialog, set the type of file as RTF. RTF
         retains most styles and formatting.

      3. Close your document. You can leave your word processor running.

   To generate the bibliography:

      1. Return to EndNote.

      2. Select Format Paper from the Tools menu, then Format Paper… (If you have previously formatted a
         paper and want to reformat it, you can also select it from the list of previously formatted papers.)

      3. Navigate to the RTF or ODT file you created, and select it.

      4. Click the Open button.

          EndNote opens the Citations dialog and begins scanning the open library, or libraries, for matches to
          the temporary citations in the document. When scanning is complete, The Citations dialog lists the
          citations found in the paper together with the number of matching references in the open libraries.
          See The Citations Dialog for Format Paper.

          The citations in the Citations dialog appear in the order they are cited in the paper. If a reference is
          cited more than once in a paper, it is listed more than once in this dialog; however the reference will
          appear only once in the bibliography.

          Every citation listed in the Citations dialog should have a "1" next to it in the Matches column,
          meaning that EndNote found exactly one reference in the open library, or libraries, to match the
          citation in the paper. When all of the citations in the window have a "1" next to them, you are ready to
          go on to the next step of formatting a paper. If a "0" or a number greater than one appears in the
          Matches column, you may need to resolve mismatched citations.

      5. Check the Citations dialog to make sure that EndNote was able to find matching references for all of
         the citations.

      6. Select a style from the Output Style menu on the Citations dialog. Enter a starting bibliography
         number if you wish.

          The individual styles listed are the styles that are currently selected as your "favorites" in the Style
          Manager. If you need to choose a style that is not in the list, choose Select Another Style… (If you




       Page 291 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


         chose Select Another Style…, select a style from the list and click the Choose button). If you do not
         see the style you want in the full list of installed styles, see Installing Additional Output Styles.

     7. In the Citations dialog, click Format to have EndNote create a copy of your paper complete with
        formatted citations and a bibliography.

     8. You are then prompted to name and save the formatted copy of the paper.

         By default, EndNote adds the name of the output style to your existing filename to create the new file
         name. You can change the name of the formatted document by typing a new name in the text box.
         You can also change the location where EndNote saves the file. By default EndNote saves the
         formatted file in the same location as the unformatted file.

          Caution: Never save the formatted paper with the same name as the original unformatted
          document. The unformatted document is needed if you ever want to format the paper again.

  While EndNote is formatting, the cursor changes to a wait cursor. When the formatting has finished, the
  cursor returns to an arrow and the Citations dialog remains open. Now that EndNote has generated a
  formatted copy of the paper, you can open that paper in your word processor.

     1. Switch to your word processor.

     2. Select Open from the word processor’s File menu, and then select and open the formatted version of
        the paper. Remember that you want to open the file that has the name of the style appended to the
        file name (or the new name you assigned, if you changed the name).

         In the formatted paper, EndNote has replaced the temporary citations with formatted citations and
         inserted a bibliography.


Making Changes to the Paper
  If you need to make changes to the paper (such as to change a citation or add more text), you should edit
  the original unformatted document, and then format it again. EndNote will generate a new formatted copy of
  the paper. See Reformatting a Paper.


Tips on Citing Sources
Temporary vs. Formatted Citations
  A "citation" is the bibliographic information in the body of a paper that refers the reader to a complete
  reference in the bibliography. Normally a citation consists of a bibliography number or the author and year in
  parentheses:

      ... of the species at hand.1
      ... of the species at hand.(Argus, 1991)

  When you first copy an EndNote citation and paste it into your paper, it appears in EndNote’s temporary
  citation format. This format consists of the first author’s last name, year, and the EndNote record number,
  with citation delimiters at each end.

      {Author, Year #Record Number}



      Page 292 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   When EndNote formats this paper it replaces the temporary citations with formatted citations.

       Temporary Citation: {Argus, 1991 #11}
       Formatted Citation (in APA): (Argus & Matthews, 1991)

   EndNote relies on the temporary citations to determine which references to include in the bibliography.
   During formatting, EndNote scans your word-processing document for temporary citations, finds their
   matching references in the EndNote library, and creates a duplicate of your document complete with
   formatted in-text citations and a bibliography at the end. This new document is called your "formatted"
   paper.

    Note: By default, citation delimiters are curly braces. If you have other text within curly braces, you may
    want to change your citation delimiters.


Multiple References in One Citation
   If you need multiple references in one in-text citation, you can accomplish this in one of two ways. One
   option is to insert all of the citations together:

   To insert multiple citations:

      1. In EndNote, hold down the Ctrl key while clicking on the desired references in your library (or hold
         down the Shift key to select a continuous range of references).

      2. From the Edit menu, select Copy (Ctrl+C).

      3. Position the cursor in your word processing document where you want the citations, and select
         Paste (Ctrl+V) from the Edit menu.

   The citations are inserted together in one set of delimiters. Once formatted, they appear in one multiple
   citation, sorted as your bibliographic style requires:

       Unformatted: {Hall, 2020 #90; Baker, 2015 #38}
       Formatted: (Baker, 2015; Hall, 2020)

   The other option is to add the citations to the paper individually. EndNote merges adjacent citations
   automatically during the formatting process. Citations do not merge, however, if any character, including
   spaces or punctuation, separates them.

       Unformatted: {Hall, 2020 #90}{Baker, 2015 #38}
       Merged when Formatted: (Baker, 2015; Hall, 2020)

    Note: If one of the citations in a multiple citation cannot be matched during formatting, the entire citation
    will remain unformatted.


Citing References in Footnotes or Endnotes with Format Paper
   Once you have created a footnote or an endnote in your word-processing document, you can cite
   references in the footnotes or endnotes just like you cite them in the body of the text.

   To cite references in footnotes:




       Page 293 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      1. In your EndNote library, select the reference(s) that you would like to cite and select Copy (Ctrl+C)
         from the Edit menu.

      2. Create the footnote or endnote using the appropriate command in your word processor. EndNote
         does not actually create the footnote or endnote in the document, but it is used to insert and format
         the citations in the notes.

      3. Position the cursor in the footnote or endnote in your paper where you would like the citation(s) to
         appear and select Paste (Ctrl+V) from the Edit menu.

    Note: You can edit a full reference footnote citation to exclude author name, year, or author/year. Note
    that the Author(Year) option does not apply to footnotes. See Components of a Temporary
    Citation and Examples of Modified Citations for information on customizing temporary citations.

   The EndNote style that is selected in the Citations dialog determines how the citations in the footnotes or
   endnotes will be formatted. EndNote can format these citations as brief in-text citations or like the complete
   references in the bibliography. It can also create a special format specific to footnotes or endnotes, including
   options like "Ibid." and other variations of shortened references when a citation appears more than once in
   the footnotes or endnotes.


Typing Citations into Your Paper in Rich Text Format (RTF) Files
   Manually entering citations is the same whether you are using Format Paper with an RTF file or Cite While
   You Write with Microsoft Word. See these topics:

       ▪ Notes About Temporary Citations

       ▪ Components of a Temporary Citation

       ▪ Omitting Authors or Years from Citations

       ▪ Citation Prefixes

       ▪ Citation Suffixes

       ▪ Including Semicolons and Other Citation Delimiters in a Citation

       ▪ Examples of Modified Citations


Record Numbers
Record Numbers When Using Format Paper
   EndNote assigns a unique record number to each reference as it is added to your library. These record
   numbers appear in the temporary citations to ensure that the correct reference is used when the paper is
   formatted:

       {Argus, 1991 #31}

   The record number for a reference is also visible in the title bar of the Reference panel.




       Page 294 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   You may also see record numbers in the Library window by selecting Record Numbers as one of the display
   fields for the Library window. See Display Fields Preferences.

   Because these record numbers are so important, keep the following points in mind:

       ▪ We recommend that you do not rely on EndNote’s record numbers as a means of filing or numbering
          your office reprints, because you have no control over this number, and it is subject to change under
          certain conditions (read on). Instead, enter your own unique number into the Label field, and use that
          number for your reprints.

       ▪ EndNote automatically assigns a record number sequentially to each reference as it is added to a
          library.

       ▪ If the same reference appears in two different libraries, the record numbers will most likely be
          different.

       ▪ The record numbers are never reused or reassigned within a library. If you delete a reference, that
          number is never used again in that library.

       ▪ You cannot modify or reassign record numbers.

       ▪ When you sync a library, or share a library through EndNote Sync, the record numbers will likely be
          different on different computers. This is because EndNote is syncing the references to a new library
          on the new computer, and each reference is assigned a new number as it is synced to that computer.

       ▪ You can set EndNote to use the Label, Accession Number, or Pages field instead of the record
          number when inserting or copying temporary citations into word-processing documents using the
          Temporary Citations preferences in EndNote. This can alleviate problems arising from different
          record numbers for the same reference when working with synced libraries and Format Paper. See
          Temporary Citations Preferences.


Deleting References in the Library
   If you delete a reference from your library after you have cited it in a paper, EndNote will not be able to find it
   when it tries to format that paper. If you add the reference to the library again, it will be assigned a new,
   different record number, so EndNote still will not be able to find it when formatting your paper. You will need
   to reinsert the citation into the paper using the new reference in your library.


Formatting Citations and Creating Bibliographies
The Citations Dialog for Format Paper
   The Citation Matches dialog opens in the EndNote program when you format a paper. It lists all of the
   citations found in a document, in the order in which they appear in the paper.

   In the Citations dialog, EndNote brings special attention to unmatched and ambiguous citations. You can
   choose from the checkbox options to show only the Matched Citations, Unmatched Citations, or Ambiguous
   Citations.

   The Citations dialog lists all of the citations found in the document and displays the number of matching
   references for each citation. If any number other than a 1 appears in the Matches column, the




       Page 295 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   corresponding citation will be left unformatted in the document and will not be included in the bibliography
   EndNote generates.

Ambiguous Citations (Matches Greater than 1)

   A number greater than 1 indicates that multiple references in the currently open library (or libraries) match
   the citation and EndNote does not know which reference to use. (EndNote automatically checks the
   matching references to see if any are duplicates. If so, they are not listed as separate possible matches.) To
   see which references are considered matches, highlight the citation in the Citations dialog and click Lookup.
   Reinsert the correct citation into the paper.

Unmatched Citations (A "Zero" Match)

   A zero in the Matches column indicates that there is no matching reference in any open library for that
   particular citation. The Author, Year, and Record Number (if used in the temporary citation) must all match
   the Author, Year, and Record Number of a reference in an open library in order for EndNote to consider it a
   match.

   If text in your document is surrounded by citation delimiters (such as "{sic}), EndNote will treat the text as a
   mismatched citation. You can ignore the warning about it being a mismatched citation, and EndNote will
   leave the text as it was before formatting. (You could also change the Citation Delimiters, see Temporary
   Citation Delimiters.)

   Uncheck the Unmatched Citations box at the top of the Citations dialog to hide these items from view if you
   have numerous sections of bracketed text in your document and the corresponding unmatched citations are
   just cluttering the Citations dialog.

Correcting Mismatched Citations

   Mismatched citations must be corrected either in the word-processing document or in the EndNote library—
   whichever contains the incorrect information. Normally, the easiest way to fix a mismatched citation is to
   search the word processing document for the mismatched citation, delete it, and then reinsert the citation
   from the library.

   If there is a citation for which EndNote lists multiple matches, you can highlight the citation in the Citations
   dialog and click Lookup. EndNote displays the matching references in the Library window. You may then
   select the appropriate reference and reinsert it into the paper. Mismatches of this type are only possible
   when the record number has been omitted from the temporary citation in the text.

   After you have corrected the mismatched citations and saved your changes to the paper, Format again.
   (The Citations dialog is still available after formatting if you want to see the list of citations.)

   The best way to avoid citation mismatches:

       ▪ Keep all of your references in one main library.

       ▪ Copy and paste your citations from EndNote to your word processing documents instead of typing
          them.

Bibliographic Styles and Format Paper
   The bibliographic style determines how EndNote formats the citations in your paper and the references in
   the bibliography. The style takes care of all text styles, punctuation, and sorting required for the citations and
   bibliography, as well as which fields are included in the bibliography.

   Select a style on the Citations dialog after selecting Format Paper. You can always run Format Paper to
   select a different style and reformat your unformatted (original) RTF document at any point. See Formatting
   the Citations and Bibliography.

   The EndNote Styles collection includes more than 7,500 styles, all of which can be modified to meet your
   specifications. You can also create completely new styles, if necessary.

   See also:

       ▪ Adding Styles to the Output Styles Menu

       ▪ Installing Additional Output Styles

       ▪ Introduction to Output Styles

       ▪ Previewing Formatted References (or Styles)

Previewing Formatted References or Styles
   The Preview subpanel in the Reference panel of the Library window displays how the currently selected
   reference will be formatted in the bibliography by the current style. This Preview subpanel shows only one
   reference at a time.

   To preview how multiple references will appear in a bibliography:

      1. Select the references in the reference list.

      2. From the Tools menu, select Output Styles and select the style that you would like to use.

      3. From the References menu, select Copy Formatted Reference (Ctrl+K).

      4. Paste (Ctrl+V) the selected references into a word processor document to see how they would look
         formatted with the selected style.


Reformatting a Paper
   Since EndNote creates a copy of the paper during the formatting process, you can always reformat the
   original document, if necessary, to create a new document with the changes that you need.

Reformatting with Different Styles

   The appearance of both the in-text citations and the bibliography in the formatted paper is determined by the
   selected style. If you need to create a copy of your paper in a different style than what you did originally:

      1. From the Tools menu in EndNote, select Format Paper > Format Paper. Open the original
         unformatted copy of your paper (the one with the EndNote citations surrounded by curly braces or
         brackets).


       Page 297 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      2. On The Citations Dialog for Format Paper, select a new output style from the Output Style drop-
         down list. You can select one of the "favorite" styles currently in the list or choose Select Another
         Style… to pick a style from the styles installed on your computer. See Installing Additional Output
         Styles for information on installing more styles.

      3. If the Citations dialog shows that all the citations in the paper are correctly matched, click the Format
         button.

      4. EndNote will prompt you to name and save the new formatted copy of the paper. Notice that the style
         name is included as part of the new paper’s name. That will help you distinguish between various
         copies of one paper.

   When you open the new formatted copy of your paper, you should see that your citations and bibliography
   use the new bibliographic format.

    Note: When you need to make changes in your paper, remember to work only with the unformatted copy
    of the paper (the one with the bracketed temporary citations), rather than the formatted copy that EndNote
    created.


Adding New Citations to Formatted Papers

   If you have already formatted your paper, and you see that it needs to be edited by either adding or
   removing citations, you must return to the original, unformatted copy of the document (the one with
   EndNote’s temporary citations). Open that document in your word processor. Add, modify, or delete citations
   as necessary, and then save the paper as RTF. You may now format the paper (as described above) to
   create an updated copy of it.


Creating One Bibliography from Several Papers
   EndNote can format a series of separate word processing documents and put a cumulative bibliography at
   the end of the last one. This is useful if you are collaborating with other EndNote users and you have each
   written a separate part of the paper or if you have separated a lengthy paper into different chapters.

   To create one bibliography from several papers:

      1. From the Tools menu, select Format Paper > Format Paper to open and scan the first paper.

      2. A Scan Next button appears in the Citations dialog (see The Citations Dialog for Format
         Paper). Click Scan Next in the dialog to open each of the subsequent papers in the correct order.
         Each paper’s citations will be added to the list of citations in the Citations dialog.

      3. When the last paper has been scanned, select an output style in the Citations dialog and click
         Format.

   During the formatting process, EndNote makes a formatted copy of each paper and puts a cumulative
   bibliography at the end of the last paper. Only the last paper in the series will include the bibliography. By
   default, each formatted paper retains its original name with the style name incorporated into it; however, you
   have the option to change the names.




       Page 298 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


Specifying the Starting Number of a Bibliography with Format Paper
   When you select Format Paper to display a Citations dialog, EndNote includes an output style list to confirm
   or change the style that should be used to format the paper. It also gives you the option to change the
   starting number for your citations and bibliography.

   If you would like EndNote’s numbering to start with a number other than "1" for the document that you are
   formatting, enter that number here. This setting is ignored if you are formatting the paper with a style that
   does not create numbered references in the bibliography.


Copying Formatted References
   There may be times when you want to insert a fully formatted reference into the body or footnotes of your
   paper without having to format an entire document.

   To insert a fully formatted reference:

      1. Select Tools > Output Styles and select the style you want from the list. If you do not see the style
         you want, select Open Style Manager and mark the style you want added to the list. The Style
         Manager will show all styles installed on your computer. If you do not see the style you want in the
         Style Manager, you can install more styles, see Installing Additional Output Styles.

      2. Select the reference(s) to copy.

      3. Select Copy Formatted Reference (Ctrl+K) from EndNote’s References menu.

      4. Switch to your word processing document, position the cursor in the text, and select Paste (Ctrl+V)
         from the Edit menu.

   If your word processor supports drag-and-drop, you may also drag the references and drop them on your
   paper with the Ctrl key pressed. This produces the same results as using the Copy Formatted Reference
   command.

   Multiple references are sorted according to the rules of the selected style. Fonts and character styles are
   transferred if you are pasting into a program that interprets styled text or Rich Text Format (RTF) information
   on the Clipboard.


Rescanning the Paper
   If there is a problem with your citation matches after selecting Format Paper, leave the Citations dialog open
   and switch to your word processor to make the necessary changes. After saving your changes, close your
   document and switch back to EndNote. On the Citations dialog, click Rescan.

   EndNote then updates the information in the Citations window to reflect the recent changes made to the
   paper.


Managing Your EndNote Library
Modifying References in Your Library
   If you add or change a reference in your library while the Citations dialog is open, make sure you click
   Rescan to have those changes reflected in the Citations dialog and in the formatted paper.


       Page 299 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   For example, if you typed the citation {Geoffery, 1988} into your paper but forgot to enter the reference in the
   library, EndNote would list a 0 in the Matches column for that citation on the Citations dialog. You can leave
   the Citations dialog open and enter the Geoffery reference into your library. Bring the Citations dialog
   forward and use the Rescan button to recheck the library for matching references. This should change the
   "0" match to a "1."


Finding EndNote References for Editing When Using Format Paper
   In the Citations dialog, you can select any number of matching references and then click Lookup to search
   and display those references in EndNote’s Library window. If you edit a reference, make sure you Rescan
   your paper to reflect the changes.


Formatting with Multiple Libraries
   Although EndNote can format papers using references from more than one library, we do not recommend
   that you use multiple libraries when writing a paper. Keeping all of your references together in one library
   simplifies the writing process because you know exactly where to find each reference, and you only need to
   have the one library open when formatting.

   If you are collaborating with other authors on a document, however, using multiple libraries for a paper may
   be a useful and necessary thing to do.

   If citations have been inserted into one document from multiple libraries, all of the necessary libraries must
   be opened in order for EndNote to format the paper correctly.

    Note: Read about the Merge Duplicates in Bibliography preference if you plan to insert citations from
    more than one library into a paper.


Finding and Labeling References Used in a Paper
   The Citations Dialog for Format Paper appears when you format a word processing document. It lists all of
   the citations found in a document, and displays the number of matching citations found in the currently open
   libraries.

   The Citations dialog is visible in the EndNote program after the formatting is finished or if the formatting
   process is canceled. (If there are problems during formatting, consult the Citations dialog. This information
   can help you resolve problems.)

   Double-click citations, or select a citation and click the Lookup button, in the Citations dialog to find the
   matching references in your EndNote library.

   To locate all of the references in a library that were cited in a paper:

      1. After formatting your paper, select all of the citations listed in the Citations dialog by selecting the first
         citation in the list, holding down the Shift key and scrolling to the bottom of the list to select the last
         citation in the list.

      2. Click the Lookup button to display the list of references in the Library window. (Note that it can only
         show references from one library in the window.)

   To add a keyword to all of these references for your own filing purposes:

      1. Select Change/Move/Copy Fields from the Library menu.

       Page 300 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


     2. On the Change Fields tab, select the Keyword field (or any other field you want to use) from the
        drop-down list of fields.

     3. Enter the term or phrase you want to use to identify these references, select any Change options you
        want (such as inserting a space before the new text if you are adding it at the end of the field), and
        click OK.

   Note: Any changes made using the Change/Move/Copy Fields command are permanent and there is no
   undo option. We strongly suggest making a backup copy of your library before using this command.
   See Saving a Compressed Copy of a Library and Saving a Copy of a Library for options for backing up
   your library.


Working on Different Computers
  If you are working on a paper on different computers, be sure to keep a copy of your reference library on the
  same disk as your paper. That way, you will always access the same library when inserting citations. If you
  add references to a copy of the library at home and to a different version at work, the record numbers may
  not match, and EndNote will be unable to find references when it scans your paper.

  Libraries synced to multiple computers or libraries shared through EndNote sync will have different record
  numbers than the original library, so using synced libraries is not suggested for use with Format Paper. See
  Record Numbers.

   Note: A compressed library will have the same record numbers as the original library. Although a working
   EndNote library should not be kept in a cloud-syncing folder or drive, a compressed library can be stored
   in one. Just remember to make a copy of it outside the cloud-syncing folder or drive, then open the copy
   that is outside the syncing folder or drive to work.

Independent Bibliographies and Exporting
References
Introduction to Independent Bibliographies
  There may be times when you want to create a bibliography without an associated paper. We call this an
  "independent bibliography" because EndNote does not generate the bibliography based on citations found
  in a paper—instead, the bibliography is generated independently of a paper.

  Any one of the procedures described in this section can be used to create an independent bibliography.
  Each has its own advantages, so look for the option that best suits your needs:

      ▪ Drag-and-drop to instantly transfer a bibliography to a word processing document.

      ▪ Copy formatted references from a library and paste them into a word processing document.

      ▪ Export references from a library as RTF, Text Only, or HTML.

      ▪ Preview and/or Print references from EndNote.

Styles Determine the Look of the Bibliography
  The appearance of your independent bibliography depends entirely on which EndNote style is selected. The
  styles determine what information is included in the bibliography, how it is arranged, and what punctuation
  and text styles are used. Select a style that meets your needs before exporting, printing, or formatting
  references.

  To select a style, select Output Styles from the Tools menu. You will see a list of "favorite" styles. This list is
  based on a short list of popular styles, with your personal favorites added as you use them. If you do not see
  the style you need in the favorites list, select Open Style Manager from the Tools > Output Styles submenu,
  and mark the styles you want added to the favorites list. For more information, see Adding Styles to the
  Output Styles Menu. For information about modifying styles, see Modifying Style Templates.

  The Style Manager shows all the styles installed on your computer. By default, EndNote installs only the
  more popular styles, but you can install more. For more information, see Installing Additional Output Styles.


Introduction to Exporting References
  EndNote can export references in formats that can be imported into databases or other bibliographic
  applications. The process is the much the same as exporting references in an independent bibliography, but
  the style used must be one that can be imported into the other program. See Exporting References as an
  Independent Bibliography and Exporting References for Database Import.


Using Drag-and-Drop to Create an Instant Bibliography
  "Drag-and-drop" is a way of moving or copying selected text (or other items) by clicking on the text and
  dragging it to a new location. Simply release the mouse button when the cursor is over the destination, and
  the text will either be moved or copied to the new destination.

      Page 302 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


  If your word processor supports drag-and-drop, you can drag a bibliography from EndNote directly into your
  paper.

  To drag your bibliography:

     1. Open your library and select the desired references.

     2. Select the necessary style from the Output Style submenu of EndNote’s Tools menu.

     3. Hold down the Ctrl key as you drag the references from the library and drop them directly onto a
        word processing document in the background.

  This creates a fully formatted bibliography with the references formatted and sorted according to the
  selected style. The font used for the bibliography in this case is the EndNote default font. You can change
  the font in your word processor.

  If your word processor does not support drag-and-drop, see The Copy Formatted Reference Command.

   Note: Dragging with the Ctrl key pressed transfers the formatted references to the word processing
   document. If you do not hold down the Ctrl key, only the temporary citation is transferred. Use this latter
   method to cite references in your paper.



The Copy Formatted Reference Command
  Use the Copy Formatted Reference command to quickly create and copy a bibliography that you can paste
  into a word-processing document. The references are sorted and formatted according to the rules of the
  selected style.

  The font used for the Copy Formatted Reference command is the default EndNote display font, which can
  be changed in your word-processing document. All text style information (such as bold and italic) is retained
  if you paste into a program that recognizes RTF (Rich Text Format) or styled text.

  To copy formatted references from EndNote and paste them into a word processing document:

   Note: If EndNote runs out of memory during this procedure, and you are trying to format 50 or more
   references, select fewer references to copy at one time, or use the drag-and-drop or Export methods
   described in this chapter.

     1. On the toolbar, go to the Output Style list and select the necessary style.

     2. Select the desired references in EndNote.

     3. From the References menu, select Copy Formatted Reference (Ctrl+K) to copy the references to the
        Clipboard.

     4. Open a document in your word processor, and select Paste (Ctrl+V) from the word processor’s Edit
        menu.

Exporting References as an Independent Bibliography
  Exporting bibliographies from EndNote is easy and flexible. When you export from a library, EndNote
  creates a file of references formatted according to the chosen style.

  You can export either all of the references in the current references list, or only the selected references in
  the current list. If any references in the Library window are selected, the EndNote export dialog gives you
  the option of exporting just those selected references.

  To export a bibliography from EndNote:

     1. Open the library from which you will export, and select the references you want to export.

         ▪ To export all of the references in the library, click the All References group.

         ▪ To export a subset of references, select a group or perform a search to show the subset of
             references you want to include. You can further limit the list of references to export by selecting
             just those references from the current reference list.

     2. (Optional) References will be exported in the order specified by the selected output style. If you want
        to change the sort order, you must modify the output style:

         a. From the Tools menu, select Output Styles, and then Open Style Manager.

         b. Select the output style and click Edit.

         c. In the left panel of the window, under Bibliography, select Sort Order.

         d. Change the current sort order in the right panel. If you want to export references in the order in
            which they are listed in the current Library window, select Order of appearance.

         e. Close and save the output style with a new name. Make a note of the new name so you can
            select it in step 5.

     3. From the File menu, select Export.

     4. From the Save as type list at the bottom of the dialog, select the type of file to be exported.
        See Supported Formats for Export for more information on file types.

     5. From the Output style list at the bottom of the dialog, select a style from your favorites, or choose
        Select Another Style… to choose from all installed output styles.

     6. Select the Export Selected References option, if desired. If you want to export all of the references in
        the current list, clear the checkbox.

     7. Navigate to the folder where you want to save the file, enter a name for the exported file, and click
        the Save button to save the file.

   Note: The Export feature creates a new file; it does not append to an existing file. If you enter the name of
   a file that already exists, that file will be overwritten.

     8. Open the exported file in a word processor to edit or print it. At this point, the file is just like any other
        text document. You can change the font, margins, line spacing, or other page layout features if



      Page 304 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


          necessary. (If you use the Open command in your word processor, make sure that the open file
          dialog is set to show files with the correct extension.)

      9. If you exported the references in HTML format, your exported reference list is ready to be posted
         directly to your Web site. In your Web browser, set encoding to "Unicode-UTF 8 to appropriately
         display extended Unicode characters.

    Note: The Export command exports only text; images are not included.



Creating Annotated Bibliographies
   Annotated bibliographies include information beyond the standard bibliographic information. They may also
   include the abstract (the Abstract field), research notes (the Research Notes field), or other notes about the
   references (the Notes field).

   To create a basic bibliography that includes abstracts, you can use the Annotated style included with
   EndNote. The Annotated style is based on the Author-Date style, and creates an alphabetical listing of the
   references (by author), with the abstract appended to each reference.

   To create a custom annotated style, see the information below.

The Abstract, Notes, and Research Notes Fields

   The fields most frequently used in annotated bibliographies are the Abstract, Notes, and Research Notes
   fields. You may add any of these fields to a style to create a custom style for your annotated bibliography.

       ▪ Abstract: Use this field to include an abstract of the reference material. When importing data from
          an online database, the abstract will be imported, if available.

       ▪ Notes: Use this field for general notes about the reference material. When importing from an online
          database, data that does not belong in a predefined field, but which might be of interest, is imported
          into the Notes field. This information may inclued variations on author names, information on related
          materials, information on photographs included in the material, etc.

       ▪ Research Notes: Use this field for your personal research notes and observations about the
          material. EndNote will never import data into the Research Notes field; it is reserved for your notes
          only.

Modifying a Style to Create an Annotated Bibliography

   For this example, we will modify the APA 7th style to include the Research Notes field. (This type of style
   would be useful if a professor requested an annotated bibliography with all your personal notes on the
   references you plan to use for a thesis or dissertation.)

      1. From the Tools menu, select Output Styles, and then select Open Style Manager.

      2. Select the APA 7th (or the style of your choice) style, and then click the Edit button to open the style
         for editing.

      3. Select Layout from the options under the Bibliography heading and click in the text box under the
         "End each reference with" heading. Text or fields inserted into this section appear at the end of each
         reference in the bibliography.


       Page 305 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      4. To insert the research notes on a new line after each reference: select End of Paragraph from the
         Insert Field list. This will ensure the contents of the Research Notes field will appear on a new line
         beneath the bibliographic data.

      5. There are options available for quick insertion on the Insert Field list, including the Abstract and
         Notes fields, but the Research Notes field we need is not on the list. The field can still be added by
         typing it in manually, being very carefull the name is entered exactly as it shows in the Generic
         reference type. In this case, "Research Notes" without the quotations marks.

      6. (Optional) If you want an extra line break after the Research Notes, you can use the Insert Field list
         to add it at the end of the End each reference with text box.

      7. From the File menu, select Save As and give the style a new name, but keep the .ens extension.
         Your new style will be saved in an \\EndNote\Styles folder in your documents folder. By storing your
         custom styles in your documents folder, EndNote ensures they will not be removed if you uninstall
         EndNote or install a new version of EndNote that might overwrite the program styles.

      8. Close the style.

   The new style will now appear in the Output Styles submenu of the Tools menu. If you format a paper, print,
   or export references using this style, the research notes will be included in the bibliography.

    Note: Some styles, such as the APA styles, are set to have a hanging indent for each paragraph. This
    means that each new line will start at the left margin and the subsequent lines in that paragraph will be
    indented. To adjust the Hanging Indent settings in your custom style, see Hanging Indents.



Printing and Previewing References
   To print references directly from EndNote, go to the File menu, and then select Print (Ctrl+P) to send a copy
   to your printer. Or, select Print Preview to format references onscreen. These are quick ways to view your
   formatted references on paper or onscreen—no special page layout options are provided. Typical uses
   might include trying out various output styles, printing a list of references to take to the library with you,
   printing your notes, or generating a complete printout of the references in an EndNote library.


Important Points about Printing
   You can print either the selected references or all references showing in the list.

   In addition to the selected style, the appearance of the printed references is determined by the following
   items:

       ▪ References will be printed in the order specified by the selected output style. If you want to change
          the sort order, you must modify the output style. If you want to export references in the order in which
          they are listed in the current Library window, change the output style's sort order setting to Order of
          appearance.

       ▪ Each printed page has 1-inch margins, left-justified text, and a header that displays the library name
          in the upper left corner and the page number in the upper right corner. There are no options to
          customize the margins, headers or footers of the printouts. Use one of the other options for creating
          an independent bibliography if you need to modify these aspects of your printout.

       ▪ The font and size of the printed references are determined by the EndNote display font. Use one of
          the other options for creating an independent bibliography if you need to modify the font.


       Page 306 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       ▪ Select Page Setup from the File menu to specify other printing options, including the paper size and
          page orientation. Page setup options vary depending on the printer used.


Printing Instructions
   To print a list of references directly from EndNote:

      1. Make sure that all of the references you want to print are either selected or showing in the Reference
         List.

      2. From the Tools menu, go to the Output Styles submenu and select a style.

      3. (Optional) References will be exported in the order specified by the selected output style. If you want
         to change the sort order, you must modify the output style:

           a. From the Tools menu, select Output Styles, and then Open Style Manager.

           b. Select the output style and click Edit.

           c. In the left panel of the window, under Bibliography, select Sort Order.

           d. Change the current sort order in the right panel. If you want to export references in the order in
              which they are listed in the current library window, select Order of appearance.

           e. Close and save the output style with a new name, then select that style.

      4. From the File menu, select Print (Ctrl+P).

          In the print dialog, specify the number of copies and the range of pages to print. By default, EndNote
          prints only the selected references. To print all of the references showing in the Reference List,
          change the print range option to All.

      5. Click OK to print the references.


Previewing References
   To preview a list of references onscreen:

      1. Make sure the references you want to preview are displayed in the Reference List.

      2. If you would like to further limit the references to preview, select just those references.

      3. From the Tools menu, go to the Output Styles submenu and select a style.

      4. (Optional) References will be exported in the order specified by the selected output style. If you want
         to change the sort order, you must modify the output style:

           a. From the Tools menu, select Output Styles, and then Open Style Manager.

           b. Select the output style and click Edit.

           c. In the left panel of the window, under Bibliography, select Sort Order.

           d. Change the current sort order in the right panel. If you want to export references in the order in
              which they are listed in the current library window, select Order of appearance.

          e. Close and save the output style with a new name, then select that style.

      5. From the File menu, select Print Preview.


Exporting References for Database Import
   There may be times when you want to share your references with a colleague who is not using EndNote, or
   bring your references into a spreadsheet or advanced database program for analysis. EndNote references
   can be exported in formats for this purpose, thanks to the flexibility of EndNote's output styles. EndNote
   includes several styles suited for imports into other programs, but you can also create your own styles if you
   need to.

   Included styles for transferring data to other programs include:

       ▪ BibTeX

       ▪ BibTeX Using EN Label Field

       ▪ RefMan (RIS) Export

       ▪ EndNote Export

       ▪ Refer Export

       ▪ Tab-Delimited

Exporting for Other Bibliographic Applications
   When you export from a library, EndNote creates a file of references formatted according to the chosen
   style. To import those references into another application, choose a style that matches a format the other
   program can import.

   You can export either all of the references in the current references list, or only the selected references in
   the current list. If any references in the Reference List are selected, the EndNote export dialog gives you the
   option of exporting just those selected references.

   To export references from EndNote:

      1. Open the library from which you will export, and select the references you want to export.

          ▪ To export all of the references in the library, click the All References group.

          ▪ To export a subset of references, select a group or perform a search to show the subset of
              references you want to include. You can further limit the list of references to export by selecting
              just those references from the current reference list.

      2. From the File menu, select Export.

      3. From the Save as type list at the bottom of the dialog, select the type of file to be exported. For most
         databases, you will need to use the plain text (.txt) format. See Supported Formats for Export for
         more information on file types.

     4. From the Output style list at the bottom of the dialog, select a style that matches the format needed
        for the target program. (A large number of programs can import data in the RefMan (RIS) Export
        format, so this is a good choice if you are unsure of the needed format.) If you do not see the style
        you need on your favorites list, choose Select Another Style… to choose from all installed output
        styles.

     5. Select the Export Selected References option if desired. If you want to export all of the references in
        the current list, clear the checkbox.

     6. Navigate to the folder where you want to save the file, enter a name for the exported file, and click
        the Save button to save the file.

   Notes: The Export feature creates a new file; it does not append to an existing file. If you enter the name
   of a file that already exists, that file will be overwritten.

   The Export command exports only text; images are not included.



Exporting to Spreadsheets or Databases
  EndNote includes a Tab-Delimited output style to provide an export format compatible with most
  spreadsheet or generic database programs.

         ▪ To export all of the references in the library, click the All References group.

         ▪ To export a subset of references, select a group or perform a search to show the subset of
            references you want to include. You can further limit the list of references to export by selecting
            just those references from the current reference list.

     2. From the File menu, select Export.

     3. From the Save as type list at the bottom of the dialog, select the type of file to be exported. For
        databases, use the plain text (.txt) format. See Supported Formats for Export for more information on
        file types.

     4. From the Output style list at the bottom of the dialog, select the Tab-Delimited style. If you do not see
        the style on your favorites list, choose Select Another Style… to choose it from the list of all installed
        output styles.

     5. Select the Export Selected References option, if desired. If you want to export all of the references in
        the current list, clear the checkbox.

     6. Navigate to the folder where you want to save the file, enter a name for the exported file, and click
        the Save button to save the file.

     7. Open your spreadsheet or database program. Follow the instructions of your database program for
        opening or importing a tab-delimited file. To add a heading row to the file, see the field list below for a
        list of fields included in the style.

Exporting to EndNote XML
  EndNote includes a proprietary XML output format which will allow other EndNote users to import your
  exported data into their library. This format is not designed to work with other bibliographic software
  applications.

  The advantage to this format for transferring data between EndNote users is that text formatting such as
  italics, bolding, superscripts, and subscripts will be included. This would not be possible when exporting a
  plain text file, as must be done to transfer to other applications.

  The data will be Unicode-compliant, so special characters and multiple languages will transfer without
  problems.

  To export references from EndNote in the XML format:

     1. Open the library from which you will export, and select the references you want to export.

         ▪ To export all of the references in the library, click the All References group.

         ▪ To export a subset of references, select a group or perform a search to show the subset of
            references you want to include. You can further limit the list of references to export by selecting
            just those references from the current reference list.

      Page 311 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


     2. From the File menu, select Export.

     3. From the Save as type list at the bottom of the dialog, select the XML (.XML) format.

     4. Do not select a style from the Output Styles list. This option is irrelevant when saving to XML.

     5. Select the Export Selected References option, if desired. If you want to export all of the references in
        the current list, clear the checkbox.

     6. Navigate to the folder where you want to save the file, enter a name for the exported file (keep
        the .xml extension), and click the Save button to save the file.

  You now have a file you can give to a colleague who uses EndNote, which can easily be imported into their
  library.

   Notes: The Export export feature creates a new file; it does not append to an existing file. If you enter the
   name of a file that already exists, that file will be overwritten.

   The Export command exports only text; images are not included.



Supported Formats for Export
Formats for Exporting Independent Bibliographies
  Use the Export command to create a free-standing bibliography in either of the following formats:

      ▪ RTF (Rich Text Format)
         The RTF export is an ideal way to create a free-standing bibliography that can be edited or printed
         using a word processor. This format can be opened by all popular word processors and preserves
         font and text style information.

      ▪ HTML
         Documents exported in HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provide an easy way to post reference
         lists on the World Wide Web.

         In your Web browser, set text encoding to Unicode-UTF 8 to appropriately display extended Unicode
         characters in the exported document.


Formats for Exporting to Other EndNote Libraries or Other Programs

      ▪ Text File
         The Text File export option is suitable for draft purposes or exporting references to be imported into
         another bibliographic database programs. It is usually used with styles such as EndNote Export,
         Refer Export, RefMan (RIS) Export, or Tab-Delimited, or you can create custom styles, as needed.
         This format cannot include formatting, such as italics, bolding, superscripts, or subscripts.

      ▪ XML
         The XML option exports in a proprietary EndNote XML format that can be imported into EndNote or
         EndNote online. The main advantage of this format over exporting a text file is that it can retain

      Page 312 of 631
  Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


     formatting that was applied to the original reference data, such as italics for species names, or
     superscripts or subscripts in chemical names.

Note: The Export command exports only text; images are not included. To reattach figures to your
records, see The Figure and Caption Fields.

Subject Bibliographies and Subject Lists
Overview of Subject Bibliographies
  A general bibliography is a continuous listing of citations in a particular order. A subject bibliography is made
  up of smaller listings, each appearing under a distinct heading. Despite the name, a subject bibliography (or
  a subject list) can be based on any EndNote field or combination of fields.

  An example of a subject bibliography might look something like this.

      REFERENCE LIST:

  Subject bibliographies have diverse uses, including: generating lists of journal abstracts, current awareness
  lists, subject indexes, or lists of holdings by category. Typical subject bibliography headings are by Keyword,
  Author, Journal Title, or Call Number.

  You can print entire bibliographic citations, information from one or more fields, record IDs, or nothing at all
  under each heading.

  When creating a subject bibliography, you have a large set of options to choose from. Below is a chart
  summarizing the steps and options available. This section will break these options down to help you
  understand the power available to you with this feature.

Subject Bibliography/List Dialog
Selecting a Subject Bibliography or a Subject List
   Select Subject Bibliography from the Tools menu to see the Subject Bibliography/List dialog.

   The dialog will display either a list of formatted references grouped by headings, or a list of terms. Which of
   these shows is controlled by the Reference List setting in the Terms dialog of the Subject
   Bibliography Setup dialog. The dialog title will always show "Subject Bibliography," even if a list of terms is
   displayed instead.

   At the top of the screen are two buttons and a drop-down list:

       Output Style: Use the Output Style list in the top left corner to select a style for formatted references.
       Only the styles selected as "favorites" are listed. If the style you want to use is not listed, choose Select
       Another Style. If you are displaying a simple list of terms, and not formatted references, this item is
       ignored. (You can also select a style, plus title and sorting options for your references, using the
       References dialog in the Subject Bibliography Setup tab. See The Subject Bibliography References
       Tab.)

       Layout: Click Layout to access the Subject Bibliography Setup dialog. See The Subject Bibliography
       Setup Dialog.

       Terms: Click Terms to return to the term selections, to either add or remove terms from the selected
       field(s). If you want to select a different EndNote field, you must close the Subject Bibliography/List
       dialog and select Subject Bibliography again from the Tools menu.

   To access the Subject Bibliography Setup panel, click the Layout button. For information on the many
   options available in this dialog, see The Subject Bibliography Setup Dialog.


Printing or Saving the Subject Bibliography or Subject List
   When you have finished setting options in the Subject Bibliography Setup Dialog, you can return to the
   Subject Bibliography/List Dialog and finish creating your subject bibliography or list using one, or more, of
   the buttons below.

       Print Preview: Click Print Preview to display a formatted page view.

       Print: Click Print to display a Print dialog. Verify settings and click OK to send the list to your printer.

       Save As : Click Save As to save a file in a text, RTF, or HTML format. A dialog appears for you to name
       the file. Select the file type, name and location of the file, and click Save.

       Close: Click Close to close the Subject Bibliography dialog.


The Subject Bibliography Setup Dialog
   The Subject Bibliography Setup dialog includes four buttons, each leading to a separate dialog controlling
   specific parts of the layout for a subject bibliography or subject list. See the topics below for details on each
   dialog.

       ▪ The Subject Bibliography References Tab


       Page 316 of 631
        Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


        ▪ The Subject Bibliography Terms Tab

        ▪ Subject Bibliography Page Layout Tab

        ▪ The Subject Bibliographies Bibliography Layout Tab

     Note: Some subject bibliography settings are updated from the current output style, so changes you make
     are not saved for future subject bibliographies. If you have special settings that you want to always use for
     subject bibliographies, it may be easier to copy and modify an output style specifically for generating
     subject bibliographies.


The Subject Bibliography References Tab
    Use the References tab to set the output style, reference list title, and reference list order. The options
    available are described below.

Output Style

    From the drop-down Output Style list, select the EndNote style you want to use for formatting references. If
    the style you want to use is not on the favorites list, choose Select Another Style from the list to select from
    the styles installed on your computer. To add styles to the favorites list, see Adding Styles to the Output
    Styles Menu. To install more styles, see Installing Additional Output Styles.

Reference List Title

    Enter the title that will print at the beginning of the subject list or subject bibliography. This can be more than
    one line. If the text box is empty, no title will print.

    To apply character styles to the Reference List Title, select the text and use these keyboard shortcuts.

        ▪ Bold: Ctrl+B

        ▪ Italics: Ctrl+I

        ▪ Underline: Ctrl+U
Reference List Order

    This allows you to select a sort order for the references that print under each subject heading. Click on the
    appropriate radio button, or create a custom sort order by choosing the Other… radio button.

    To reset the values on this tab, click the EndNote Defaults button.


The Subject Bibliography Terms Tab
    The Terms tab options apply specifically to subject terms (or headings), not to references.

     Note: The options on this tab are saved for the current subject bibliography session and for future
     sessions, until you change them again. So, if you generate a list of Subject Terms Only, the next time you
     select Subject Bibliography, you will produce a simple subject list again. To include formatted references,
     click the Layout button and the Terms button to select Subject Terms and Reference List.




        Page 317 of 631

Selecting a Subject List or Subject Bibliography

   In the Reference List area, select one of the two radio buttons:

       ▪ Subject Terms Only: This option prints each unique subject term. It does NOT print formatted
          references below each term. Use this for a simple list of terms.

       ▪ Subject Terms and Reference List: This option prints each subject term with related references
          listed below it.

   When printing subject terms with reference lists, EndNote typically prints each unique subject heading only
   once, with the related references listed below. You can select the Repeating Subject Terms box to print a
   subject term before each and every formatted reference (example below).

       Avian cognition (2)
       Pepperberg, I. M. (2011). Avian cognition and social interaction Fifty years

   Select the Recycling Reference Numbers box to restart reference numbering under each subject heading. If
   your starting reference number is 1, each list of references under each subject heading will start with 1.
   Deselect this item if you want sequential numbering throughout the document. This setting is used only if the
   current output style specifies reference numbering. To set the beginning number, see Subject Bibliographies
   Bibliography Layout Tab.

        2. Second formatted reference                 4. Second formatted reference


Including Subject Term Counts or Record IDs

   Check the box to include:

       ▪ Subject Term Counts: This option prints a number next to the subject term to indicate how many
          records contain the term. For example:

          Evolution          (1)
          Excavation          (4)
          Extinction          (12)

          Subject term counts always print on the same line as the subject term, surrounded by parentheses,
          and separated from the term by three spaces.

       ▪ List of Record IDs: This option prints the record IDs (the EndNote record number) of the records
          that contain the term. For example:


       Page 318 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


           Excavation        34,         33,   6,     48
           Extinction        34,         46,   6,     10,        125,   132,     148,      162

        Note: EndNote record numbers are not permanent and apply only to the library used to create the
        Subject Bibliography or Subject List. They can change when syncing or copying. See Record
        Numbers.


Sorting the Subject Terms

   You have four options for ordering your subject terms:

       ▪ By Term — Alphabetical: This option sorts subject terms by date for Year fields, and then
           alphanumeric order (1-9, A-Z) for all other fields.

       ▪ By Term — Inverse Alphabetical: This option reverses the By Term — Alphabetical order (Z-A, 9-1,
           Years).

       ▪ By Term Count — Ascending: This option lists terms based on how often they appear in records.
           For example, a term that appears in only one reference would display at the top of the list, whereas a
           term used in 20 references would appear further down in the list.

       ▪ By Term Count — Descending: This option reverses the By Term Count — Ascending order, so the
           most-used terms are listed first.

    Note: This sort order setting affects subject headings only. If you want to change the order of the
    references printed below each heading, do so on the References tab of the Subject Bibliography Setup
    dialog. See The Subject Bibliography References Tab.


Inserting Space or Text Around Subject Terms

   Use the Prefix and Suffix text boxes to print text or punctuation before or after each subject term.

   Each term may include a subject term count and/or a list of record IDs. The order of output is:

   Text Before | Subject Term | Subject Term Count |
   List of Record IDs | Text After | Reference List

   You can use these special formatting codes in the text boxes:

        New Paragraph               ^p

        New Line                    ^l

        Tab                         ^t

        Bold                        Ctrl+B

        Italic                      Ctrl+I

        Underline                   Ctrl+U

   By default, the Prefix box contains "^p" and the Suffix box contains "^p^p" in order to leave blank lines
   between each subject heading and the first citation listed below it.




       Page 319 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   When you print Subject Terms Only, you will probably want to print only a single "^p" after each term, so
   each subject term begins on a new line with no blank lines between them.

Applying Styles

   In the Styles area, check the appropriate boxes to separately apply styles to Subject Terms, Subject Term
   Counts, and the List of Record IDs. You can combine styles in any way, such as:

       Antarctica (2) 144, 12
       Antarctica (2) 144, 12

   Apply styles to bibliographic references by modifying the output style.

   If you save your list to a plain text file, all styles will be stripped.


Subject Bibliography Page Layout Tab
   This tab includes options for font, font size, margins and page numbers.

Font and Size

   Type or select a font and size for the references in your subject bibliography. EndNote lists currently
   available fonts. Sizes available depend on the printer and the selected font.

Margins

   The margin is the distance between the edge of the page and the printed text. Enter your margins (in
   inches) into the appropriate boxes.

Page Numbers

   Select whether or not to number the pages. If you choose to number pages, enter a starting page number.
   You can also choose whether or not to suppress the first page number for the title page.

   Page numbers can appear in a header or a footer. The alignment can be left, right, or center.


The Subject Bibliographies Bibliography Layout Tab
   The options available on the Bibliography Layout tab affect only the bibliographic references printed in a
   subject bibliography. These settings are not used when you print a simple subject list.

    Note: When you select an output style, the settings on this tab change to reflect the settings found in the
    output style. You can override those settings for the current session, but changes to this tab are not saved
    after you close the subject bibliography window. If you want to make the changes permanent, edit the
    output style. You can make a copy of the output style to edit specifically for subject bibliographies.


Starting and Ending Each Reference with a Special Character or Text

   Use the "Start each reference with" and the "End each reference with" text boxes to enter fields, text, or
   punctuation to print before and after every formatted reference.




       Page 320 of 631
    Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


Simply click in one of the text boxes and type text. You can use the Insert Field button to enter control
characters or fields of information as described below.

Use the Insert Field buttons to insert any of the control characters below in a text box. These are standard
control characters used in EndNote output styles.

    End of Paragraph inserts a paragraph marker, which moves the following text to the next line.

    Tab inserts a tab character. The spacing for tabs is determined by the ruler settings in your word
    processor.

    Forced Separation inserts a vertical bar. Use vertical bars to detach punctuation from a specific field.
    See Forced Separation—Using the Vertical Bar.

    Link Adjacent Text inserts a nonbreaking space. See Link Adjacent Text (Using the Nonbreaking
    Space).

    Singular/Plural works with author (including editors) and pages fields to place different characters with
    the field depending on if there are a single or multiple number of authors or pages listed. For example, if
    there was one editor listed, it might show "John Smith, ed.," but if there were two editors, it might show
    "John Smith, Matt Jones, eds." See Singular/Plural Term Separator (Caret ^).

Enter these fields of information in the "Start each reference with" box by clicking the Insert Field button and
selecting the field name:

    Reference Type prints the Reference Type of each reference.

    Label prints the Label field from each reference.

    Citation prints the in-text citation form of each reference.

    Bibliography Number prints a bibliography number. It is best to avoid using this option in subject
    bibliographies. Using a numbered style will include the bibliography number.

    Record Number prints the Record Number from each reference.

Enter these fields of information in the "End each reference with" box by clicking the Insert Field button and
selecting the field name:

Creating a Subject Bibliography
   To create a subject bibliography:

      1. Select a group or perform a search to find the references to include in the subject bibliography. All
         showing references will be included.

          ▪ Click on the All References group to include all references in the subject bibliography.

          ▪ Click on a Group name to display only the references in a specific group.

          ▪ Perform a search to find a subset of references for your subject bibliography. See The Advanced
             Search Panel.

          ▪ If none of the methods above work, you may find it easiest to create a custom group to hold the
             references you want to use for the subject bibliography.

      2. Click in the reference list to make it the active panel.

      3. From the Tools menu, select Subject Bibliography to display a list of EndNote fields by default field
         name.

      4. Select the field(s) whose contents you wish to use as subject headings.

          ▪ The most common selection is the single Keywords field to create a subject bibliography.

          ▪ You can include any number of fields. If you build the list of headings from more than one field,
             the subject headings generated from these fields are combined into a single list.

          ▪ If you mix the Year field with other fields, the year will sort before alphabetic subject headings.

          ▪ To quickly select all fields or clear all fields, use the buttons on the right side of the dialog.
      5. Select checkboxes as needed to determine whether an entire field is used as a heading, or whether
         a field should be split into multiple headings.

          ▪ List each author separately: When checked, this option will list each author name as a separate
             heading. If not checked, all authors from a single field will appear as a single heading.

          ▪ In other fields, list each entry that is separated by slash, carriage return, or line feed:
             When checked, this option separates any nonauthor field into multiple subject headings if a slash,
             carriage return, or line feed is present.

          ▪ Terms in the Keywords field are always listed as separate headings.

Customizing EndNote
 Sometimes you need something "special." It could be a custom style for a professor or journal. It could be
 an unusual reference type, or a newly invented reference type. After all, blogs, ebooks, and various other
 electronic references types were new not so long ago, and more new ones are sure to be invented. You
 could be a network administrator trying to figure out how to distribute EndNote to members of an academic
 community or workplace. If you need that something special, this is the section for you.

 This section covers creating custom output styles, import filters, connection files, and reference types. It also
 covers custom installations, customizing preferences, and anything that does not fall under the headings of
 EndNote Libraries and References or Working with Documents using EndNote references.




     Page 328 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide




Reference Types
  Your EndNote library can contain references from a variety of different sources, such as books, journal
  articles, and newspaper articles. We call these different sources reference types. EndNote provides built-in
  forms for these and other common reference types.

  The reference type table shows which fields are used in each of the 57 different reference types (plus a
  Generic reference type) and what the fields are called. The Generic reference type is repeated several times
  so that you can easily compare an individual field to its Generic field name. For descriptions of special fields,
  see Special Fields.

  See Reference Types and Fields for a list of the reference types and links to a detailed list of fields for each
  reference type.


Important Points About Reference Types
      ▪ You can assign a particular reference type to each reference entered into your library.

      ▪ The Reference Types preference, accessible through EndNote’s Preferences, determines which
         fields are available for each of the different reference types.

      ▪ The Reference Types preference allows up to 58 different types of references (including a Generic
         reference type), each capable of supporting up to 54 fields (including the name of the reference
         type). Of these, 52 fields can be edited. The Added to Library and Last Updated fields can be shown
         in the Reference List, but cannot be changed by the user.

      ▪ Of the 58 reference types, all but the Generic type can be modified.

      ▪ Use the Reference Types preference to add, delete, or rename fields. You can also add or hide
         complete reference types.

      ▪ The layout of the Generic reference type should be used as a guide when modifying or creating
         reference types. Rows reserved for Authors should be used only for names, the Year field should be
         used only for the year of publication, etc.

      ▪ Changes made to the Reference Types preference apply to all libraries opened under the current
         user account.

      ▪ If you move your library to a different computer, your references will follow the layout of the
         Reference Types preference for the current user account on that computer, unless you also transfer
         a copy of your reference type table. See Backing Up or Sharing Your Reference Types Table.

      ▪ Do not enter reference data into the Reference Types preference. This dialog is designed to store
         just the names of the reference fields.

      ▪ When you use Cite While You Write to insert figures in Microsoft Word, figures found in the Chart or
         Table reference type are inserted as tables. Figures found in any other reference type in EndNote will
         format as figures in Word.

Reference Types and Data Entry
  The chosen reference type specifies which fields appear in the Reference window. For instance, an
  EndNote journal article reference includes the fields Journal, Volume, and Issue, while a book reference
  includes fields such as Publisher and City. The Reference window only displays the fields that are relevant
  to the chosen reference type.

  It is best to select the reference type before entering the bibliographic information in a reference. However,
  you can change the reference type of a reference at any time using the Reference Type list at the top of the
  Reference Edit panel.


Relationship Between Reference Types and Styles, Filters, and Connections
  Styles, filters, and connection files can include templates for all of the different reference types. This enables
  various types of references to be formatted differently in a bibliography or imported differently, as necessary.

  The reference types and fields available to you when editing a style, filter, or connection file depend on how
  the reference types are configured in the Reference Types preference. These files update automatically to
  reflect changes made in the Reference Types preference (such as changing the name of a field).


The Generic Reference Type
  When entering references into your library, use the Generic type only for references that do not fit any of the
  other reference types. The more important function of the Generic reference type is to set up a guide for the
  other reference types to follow.

  The Generic field names are used throughout the EndNote program (for example, in the Sort References
  dialog and the Search panel) to refer to a similar category of fields that can be found in the different
  reference types. When you choose a Generic field name in any of these dialogs, it refers to all field names
  assigned to that Generic row of the Reference Types preference. For example, if you use the Search
  command to search the Author field, EndNote searches all fields that appear in the Generic Author row of
  the Reference Types preference, including fields such as Artist, Reporter, and Cartographer.

   Note: When editing the Reference Types preference it is important that you keep similar fields in the
   same row, as defined by the Generic field names of the row. Each reference type can call these fields by
   a different name; however, the content of the fields should be similar.

Using the Generic Type in Styles
   Although the Generic reference type is rarely used for data entry, it plays an important role in formatting
   bibliographies. In addition to formatting Generic references, the Generic template in a style is used to format
   any reference types that are not specifically defined in the style. Consequently, every bibliographic style
   should contain a Generic template so that all references get formatted when EndNote creates a
   bibliography.


Setting a Default Reference Type
   By default, the Journal Article reference type appears when you insert a new reference. While you can
   change the assigned reference type during data entry, you may want to change the default setting.

   To change the default reference type setting:

      1. From the Edit menu, select Preferences.

      2. Click on Reference Types.

      3. Click the Default Reference Type list and choose from one of the available reference types.

      4. Click Apply to save the change.


The Reference Types Preference
   The Reference Types preference displays the available reference types and the fields that each reference
   type contains. Use the Reference Types preference to add, remove, or rename fields—or to rename a
   reference type.

    Note: Much like your EndNote library, any changes you make to your Reference Types should be
    backed up. See Backing Up or Sharing Your Reference Types Table for more information.

   To access the Reference Types preference:

      1. From the Edit menu, select Preferences.

      2. Click the Reference Types option in the list of preferences.

      3. Click the Modify Reference Types button and the Modify Reference Types dialog will open.

      4. Use the drop-down list at the top to display one of the 57 editable reference types.

   The first column of the Modify Reference Types dialog is reserved for the Generic reference type, which lists
   all of the available fields.

   The rows correspond to the editable fields that each reference type can contain (including the name of the
   reference type). Each named cell in a column represents a field that appears in the reference. The names of
   the fields in each reference type should closely correspond to their Generic field names in the left column.

   The Generic column is the complete set of fields that can be included in any type of reference—no fields
   can be added to this list, nor can the names of the Generic fields be changed. The Generic Reference Type
   serves as a model for constructing all other reference types.

Navigating in the Modify Reference Types Dialog

      ▪ Use the vertical scroll bar to see the additional fields available for each reference type.

      ▪ If you decide to undo your changes to the reference types and revert to the EndNote defaults, click
         EndNote Defaults to return all reference type settings to their original EndNote settings.

          Note: Clicking EndNote Defaults in the Modify Reference Types dialog will revert the reference
          type you are editing to the default, but clicking EndNote Defaults in the Reference Types
          Preference dialog will revert all changes that have ever been made to the defaults.


      ▪ If you want the change you made to apply to all reference types, click Apply to All Ref Types to
         change the field for all reference types.

          Caution: Use extreme caution with the Apply to All Ref Types button. It will change all fields that
          correspond to that field in the Generic reference type. For example, if you changed the Custom 2
          field in the Manuscript reference type to My Keywords, then clicked Apply to All Fields, you would
          replace the PMCID field in the Journal Article reference type to My Keywords instead of PMCID.


      ▪ Click OK to save your changes and to close the Modify Reference Types dialog. Click Apply when
         you return to the EndNote Preference dialog to save your settings OR click Cancel to exit from the
         Reference Types preference without saving any changes.


Customizing Reference Types
  All of the reference types, except for Generic, can be modified using the Reference Types preference.
  Whenever you make a change to a reference type, you should also edit your styles to make sure that they
  correctly format the new or modified reference types.

   Note: Much like your EndNote library, any changes you make to your Reference Types should be
   backed up. See Backing Up or Sharing Your Reference Types Table for more information.

  If you plan to share your libraries with other users, you may want to limit the use of new and modified
  reference types. The changes you make to the Reference Types preference apply to all libraries opened on
  a computer from your user account. If your library is opened from a different computer or a different user
  account, your references will follow the layout of the Reference Types preference for that computer and
  user, unless you also transfer a copy of your reference type table. See Backing Up or Sharing Your
  Reference Types Table.

  If you modify a reference type for records in your EndNote library, you should make sure that the reference
  type is also created or modified on other computers that will access the library.

  Do not try to edit the Reference Types preference to rearrange information within your references. For
  example, if you delete the Journal field and retype "Journal" elsewhere in the column for Journal Articles,
  you are telling EndNote to close the original Journal field and display a new field called "Journal" in another
  location—this does not move your data from the original Journal field to the new one. Any references that
  had data in the original Journal field will still show that information, but the field will have its Generic name of
  Secondary Title. The new Journal field will remain empty.

   Note: EndNote Web/Online will always use the default EndNote reference types, so changes you make to
   your reference types on the desktop will not be reflected in your EndNote account.

Adding, Changing, and Hiding Reference Types
  There are three Reference Types titled Unused, where you can define a new type of reference. If these are
  already in use, you can overwrite other reference types that you do not need in order to create new
  reference types. For example, if your subject area never involves art, you may have no use for the Artwork
  reference type; you could replace it with another reference type.

  To add a new reference type:

     1. From the Edit menu, select Preferences.

     2. Select the Reference Type option in the list of preferences, and then click Modify Reference Types to
        open the Modify Reference Types dialog.

     3. Use the drop-down list at the top to select one of the Unused reference types. If all of the
        Unused reference types are in use, select a reference type that you are willing to overwrite.

     4. Type a name for that new reference type into the column heading.

          Note: A reference type must have fields defined in order to appear in the reference type list for
          new or existing references. If you change the name of an Unused reference type, it will not appear
          in your reference type list. You must also include fields in the reference type as described below.

     5. Continue down the column for that reference type, adding new fields as necessary. (Delete or
        rename unwanted fields if you are overwriting another reference type.) Remember to match the
        meaning of the fields you add with the Generic row headings. It is often helpful to use other
        reference types as guides, too.

     6. Click OK after you have added all of the necessary fields, and you will return to the main Preferences
        window for Reference Types.

     7. Click Apply to save your changes.

     8. Click OK to close the Preferences window and save your changes.

  You can now use this new reference type when entering references. You should also edit your styles so that
  they correctly reflect the type of format required for this new reference type. If you overwrite an existing
  reference type, any references that used the old reference type will change to use the new reference type.


      Page 334 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


    Note: If you ever plan to use journal articles in your library, do not overwrite the Journal Article or
    Electronic Article reference types. These two reference types are the only ones for which journal
    abbreviation replacements can be made with the Journals Term List.


To Hide an Unwanted Reference Type

      1. From the Edit menu, select Preferences, select the Reference Type option in the list of preferences,
         and then click Modify Reference Types to open the Modify Reference Types dialog.

      2. Use the drop-down list at the top to find the reference type that you want to hide.

      3. Add a period before the reference type’s name in the column header to have EndNote remove that
         item from the Reference Type list in the Reference Edit panel, when creating a new reference, and
         elsewhere. The definition, however, remains in case you later wish to restore it by removing the
         period. (To find the reference type that you hid in the future, go to the top of the list of references, the
         period (.) before the name will be at the beginning because the reference types are in alphabetical
         order.)

          For example, if you were hiding the Map reference type, the column heading would be .Map.

      4. Click OK to return to the main Preferences window for Reference Types.

      5. Click OK to save your changes and close the Preferences window.

   Once you have hidden a reference type, you should not select it under Preferences as the default reference
   type for new references; if you do, EndNote will default to the Generic reference type.


Adding, Deleting, and Renaming Fields
   There are different ways you can customize the various reference types. If an existing reference type does
   not contain all of the fields that you need, you can define a new field or rename an existing field. Similarly, if
   there is a field that you know you will never use, you can delete it from the reference type so that it no longer
   appears in your references.

    Note: Be sure to read about Special Fields before changing any fields.


To Add a Field to a Reference Type

      1. From the Edit menu, select Preferences, select the Reference Type option in the list of preferences,
         and click Modify Reference Types to open the Modify Reference Types dialog.

      2. Use the drop-down list at the top to find the reference type that you want to change.

      3. Look at the field names listed in the Generic column and find the one with the most similar meaning
         to the field that you want to add. Make sure that the corresponding cell is blank for the reference type
         that you are modifying. If it is not blank, then you should use another field.

      4. Click in the blank cell and type the name for the new field.

      5. Click OK to return to the main Preferences window for Reference Types.

      6. Click OK to save your changes and close the Preferences window.

       Page 335 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


To Rename a Field

      1. From the Edit menu, select Preferences, select the Reference Type option in the list of preferences,
         and click Modify Reference Types to open the Modify Reference Types dialog.

      2. Use the drop-down list at the top to find the reference type that you want to change.

      3. Within the column for that reference type, find the field name that you want to change, click on it, and
         type a new name for the field to replace the current name.

      4. Click OK to return to the main Preferences window for Reference Types.

      5. Click OK to save your changes and close the Preferences window.

   Styles, filters, and connection files update automatically to use the new name.


To Delete a Field from a Reference Type

      1. From the Edit menu, select Preferences, select the Reference Type option in the list of preferences,
         and click Modify Reference Types to open the Modify Reference Types dialog.

      2. Use the drop-down list at the top to find the reference type that you want to change.

      3. Find the name of the field you want to delete and select it.

      4. Press the Delete or Backspace key to clear that field name.

      5. Click OK to return to the main Preferences window for Reference Types.

      6. Click OK to save your changes and close the Preferences window.

   The deleted field no longer appears in any references using that reference type. However, if there was any
   information in the deleted field, it still appears in the reference, but the field is displayed with its Generic
   name. For example, suppose you remove the Editor field from the Book reference type. Thereafter, when
   you add new book references to your library, there will be no available field for entering an editor. However,
   if you edit an old book reference, one in which you had entered an editor’s name, the name would be
   displayed in the field titled Secondary Author. It is the same Editor field that was used originally, however it is
   now displayed with its Generic name.

   Data in a field is not deleted by deleting a field from a reference type. To remove all text from a field, use the
   Clear Field option in the Change Fields command. You can also move data from one field to another using
   the Change Fields command.


Backing Up or Sharing Your Reference Types Table
   An EndNote user can share a customized reference type table with another EndNote user. Keep in mind,
   however, that when you do this, you completely replace the recipient’s existing reference type table.


Backup or Share a Reference Types Table

      1. From the Edit menu, select Preferences.

      2. Click the Reference Types option in the list of preferences.

       Page 336 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      3. Under Reference Type Table, click Export to display the Save As dialog.

      4. Name the file, select a folder where you will be able to find it later, and click Save. EndNote will
         append an .xml suffix to the file name.

   You now have a backup of your Reference Types Table.

   To share your reference types with a colleague, send them a copy of the saved file.


Importing a Reference Types Table

    Note: When you import another user's Reference Type Table, you will overwrite the entire contents of
    your current Reference Type Table, losing any customizations you have made to your reference types.
    We suggest creating a backup of your current Reference Type Table before importing a new table, using
    the instructions above.

      1. From the Edit menu, select Preferences.

      2. Click the Reference Types option in the list of preferences.

      3. Under Reference Type Table, click Import to display a file dialog.

      4. In the file dialog, locate, highlight, and open the .xml file that was previously exported.


Special Fields
   EndNote includes 52 editable fields (including the first field, which contains the name of the reference type).
   Each of the different EndNote data fields is available for use by the different reference types. Initially, only
   the Generic reference type includes all fields. Few restrictions are placed on the type of text that can be
   entered. However, there are a few fields that are reserved for specific functions.

    Note: Although the fields Added to Library and Last Updated are shown in the Reference Types and
    Fields tables, they do not appear in the Reference Types preferences because they cannot be edited.
    They are always present and can be shown in the Reference List, but cannot be changed by the user.


Author Fields
   The Author, Secondary Author, Tertiary Author, and Subsidiary Author rows in the Reference Types are
   specially configured to handle Author and Editor Names, and should not be used for any data other than
   names.

   When EndNote creates a bibliography, the information in these fields is formatted according to the
   specifications of the selected style’s Author List and Editor List settings. (The Author List is used for the
   Author field; Editor List is used for Secondary Author, Tertiary Author, and Subsidiary Author fields.) If you
   put text other than personal names in any of these fields, EndNote will still try to interpret it and format it as
   a person’s name.

   The first author's last name is used in temporary citations inserted into word-processing documents. The
   Reference List can display just the last name of the first author that it finds in the Author field, or a list of
   author names (see Display All Authors in the Author Field).




       Page 337 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


    Note: If you have a corporate author name in an Author field, put a comma after the name so that
    EndNote does not interpret it as a first and last name. See Author and Editor Names for information on
    entering corporate and complex author names.


Title Fields
   The three fields that the Generic type uses for the Title Fields—Title, Secondary Title, and Tertiary Title—are
   usually found under different names in other reference types. For example, a section of a book which is part
   of a series will use all three title fields: the chapter title would belong in the main Title field, the book title
   corresponds to the Secondary Title field, and the series title corresponds to the Tertiary Title field.

   The Generic Secondary Title and Alternate Title fields map to the Journal and Alternate Journal fields,
   respectively. The fields listed below, found in specific reference types, are the only ones that can be used
   with the Journals term list to modify journal names in formatted bibliographies.

   Journal Article reference type—Journal field

   Journal Article reference type—Alternate Journal field

   Electronic Article reference type—Periodical Title field

   Electronic Article reference type—Alternate Title field


Pages Field
   The fields in the row reserved for page numbers are the only ones that work with the Page Numbers option
   in the styles. This feature lets you specify how EndNote should format the page numbers in the bibliography
   (first page only, or a full or abbreviated range of pages). Similarly, any field in the Pages row of the
   Reference Types Table can take advantage of a special formatting character in the styles: the caret (^). This
   character allows you to pick a singular and plural form of a term to precede or follow the pages in a
   bibliography, for example "p. 25" and "pp. 32-45." If you enter page numbers in any other part of the
   reference, they cannot be used with these features.


URL Field
   When a correctly formatted URL is entered into this field, the Open URL command in the References menu
   can be used to launch your Web browser and take you to that site.

   When a reference is selected and Open URL is chosen, EndNote checks the URL field for a URL. No other
   fields are checked. See URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and Linking a URL to an EndNote Reference.


File Attachments Field
   Use The File Attachments Field to store the path to files on your hard drive (such as graphics, word
   processing documents, and PDF files). You can specify an absolute path to a specific folder, or you can
   specify a relative path to copy the file to your library’s .Data\PDF folder. You can link up to 45 files to each
   reference. See Selecting a Relative Path or an Absolute Path for File Attachments for more information on
   absolute and relative paths.

   When a correctly formatted path and filename is entered into this field, the Open File command in the
   References menu can be used to open the file. See Linking a File to an EndNote Reference.



       Page 338 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


Figure and Caption Fields
   The Figure and Caption Fields store a single graphic or file attachment specifically for use in Microsoft
   Word, and the caption for that graphic. These fields are included in all reference types. See Figures for
   information about adding figures to a reference.

   To add or remove the Figure or Caption fields from a reference type, use the Preferences dialog to edit
   reference types, as described in Adding, Deleting, and Renaming Fields.


Date Stamp Fields
   Two Auto Date Stamp fields are available that you can add to the Reference List display.

   The Added to Library and Last Updated date fields are inserted when you save a new reference. The Last
   Updated date is reset each time you save changes to a reference. The date format of the Auto Date Stamp
   fields matches your default operating system settings (for example, 4/16/2021).

   To add the two Auto Date Stamp fields to the Reference List display, select Preferences > Display Fields.
   From the Field column, select the Added to Library and/or Last Updated fields. EndNote populates the
   Heading column with your selection.

   Another way to add these fields to the Reference List display is to right-click on a column heading, then
   choose them from the list.

   You cannot edit, print, or export either of the Auto Date Stamp fields. You can, however, display and sort
   these fields just as you can any other EndNote field.

    Note: For references entered with EndNote version X1 or earlier, the Added to Library field is left blank
    and the Last Updated field displays the date of conversion to EndNote.

Output Styles
Introduction to Output Styles
What is an Output Style?
  The term "output style" (or just "style") is used to describe a particular method of documenting your work.
  Each style is designed as a complete solution for formatting and editing in-text citations, footnote citations,
  and bibliographies for all types of references.

  You can think of styles as templates that show EndNote how to arrange the information in each of your
  EndNote references for citations and bibliographies. For example, a single reference could be formatted in
  the Chicago style like this:

      Emery, N. J., and N. S. Clayton. "Tool Use and Physical Cognition in Birds
      and Mammals." Review. Current Opinion in Neurobiology 19, no. 1 (Feb 2009):
      27-33. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conb.2009.02.003.

  Or it could be formatted in the Nature style like this:

      1     Emery, N. J. & Clayton, N. S. Tool use and physical cognition in birds
            and mammals. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 19, 27-33,
            doi:10.1016/j.conb.2009.02.003 (2009).

  EndNote includes over 7,500 individual bibliographic styles. With a standard installation, only the most
  popular styles are installed in the Styles folder in your EndNote folder, but you can add more styles, if you
  wish. (See Installing Additional Output Styles.)

  The name of the style refers to the journal or publisher that has defined the bibliographic format. The Nature
  style, for example, is based on the format required by the journal Nature, and the Chicago style is named
  after the Chicago Manual of Style. Styles in the Export category, such as RefMan (RIS) Export are not
  bibliographic styles, but rather export styles designed to aid in transferring EndNote data into other
  databases. (See Exporting References for Database Import for information on exporting data from
  EndNote.)

  To see the available styles in EndNote’s Styles folder, select Output Styles from the Tools menu, and select
  Open Style Manager…. If your style is not available, you can download additional styles. Any style can be
  modified to suit your needs, plus you can create new styles.

      ▪ Styles can be downloaded or edited, and new styles can be customized, through EndNote's Style
          Manager. (Select EndNote Output Styles from the Help menu or click Get More on the Web… to
          download styles from the EndNote site.)

      ▪ The Style Manager allows you to find and preview installed styles. Commonly used styles can be
          marked as "favorites," which will appear in the Output Styles submenu of the Tools menu and in the
          list of available styles in Cite While You Write.




      Page 456 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


The Output Styles Menu
  The style selected from the Output Styles submenu of the Tools menu determines how references are
  formatted for the preview subpanel in the Reference panel, as well as for the Format Bibliography, Format,
  Print, Export, and Copy Formatted Reference commands.

  By default, these standard bibliographic styles are set as favorites in your Output Styles menu:

      ▪ Annotated: This style generates Author-Date citations. The bibliography includes abstracts.

      ▪ APA 7th: This style displays all authors if there are twenty or less; if there are twenty-one or more, it
         displays the first nineteen authors (or editors), followed by a comma and an ellipsis, followed by the
         last author (or editor).

      ▪ Author-Date: This style generates a bibliography alphabetized by author name, and in-text citations
         with the Author and Year.

      ▪ Chicago 17th Footnote: This style is based on the Chicago Manual of Style, 17th edition. It contains
         footnotes and a bibliography.

      ▪ MHRA (Author-Date): This style is based on the Modern Humanities Research Association style. An
         MHRA footnote style is also available.

      ▪ Numbered: This style generates a numbered bibliography with corresponding numbered in-text
         citations.

      ▪ Show All Fields: This style generates a list of the references as entered, including all fields and the
         names of the fields.

      ▪ Turabian 9th Footnote: This style is based on the 9th edition of A Manual for Writers of Research
         Papers, Theses, and Dissertations.

      ▪ Vancouver: This style is based on the "Medical Journal" requirements in Citing Medicine, published
         by the US National Institutes of Health at http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html.

  Mark individual styles as your favorites in The Style Manager to have them appear in the Output Styles
  menu, the Reference Preview subpanel, and when using Cite While Your Write, Format Paper, or Export
  commands.


The Style Manager
  EndNote includes more than 7,500 individual bibliographic styles. By default, only the most popular styles
  are stored as individual files in the Styles folder in your EndNote folder. To install additional styles, see
  Installing Additional Output Styles.

  The name of the style refers to the journal or publisher that has defined the bibliographic format. The Nature
  style, for example, is based on the format required by the journal Nature, and the Chicago style is named
  after the Chicago Manual of Style. Styles in the Export category, such as RefMan (RIS) Export are not
  bibliographic styles, but rather export styles designed to aid in transferring EndNote data into other
  databases.

  To see if your journal’s style is installed in EndNote, peruse the list of styles in the Style Manager. If your
  style is not available, any style can be modified to suit your needs, you can create new styles, or you can
  install additional styles (see Installing Additional Output Styles).



      Page 457 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   To see the available styles in EndNote’s Styles folder, select Output Styles from the Tools menu, and then
   select Open Style Manager.

   The Style Manager lists the names of the original styles available in the C:\Program Files (x86)\EndNote
   2025\Styles folder as well as any new or modified styles in your personal Styles folder. It gives you options
   to edit styles or select them as “favorites” for quick access from the Output Styles menu on the Tools menu,
   or anywhere a styles list is shown. You can click and drag the corner of the dialog to increase the size.

Navigating in the Style Manager

   Use the following features to locate the output style that you want to use:

       ▪ If you know the name of the style that you want to use, you may start typing it and the first file that
          matches what you type will be selected.

       ▪ Click the Find By button and choose a category (such as Biochemistry or Humanities) to find only the
          bibliographic styles for a specific discipline.

       ▪ Click the Find By button and select All Styles to return all of the installed styles to the displayed list.

       ▪ Click the column headings to sort the styles by name or by category. Clicking the same column
          heading a second time will change the sort order from ascending to descending. Click again to set it
          back to ascending order.

       ▪ Click the More Info button at the bottom of the dialog to display additional information about the
          selected style (such as modification and creation dates, and any comments or limitations). More Info
          toggles with Less Info. You also have the option of displaying a preview of the style in the More Info
          panel.

Marking Your Favorite Styles

   When you have found a style that you want to use, click the checkbox to mark it as a favorite. All styles that
   are marked as favorites appear in the Styles menu. This gives you easy access to the styles you use most
   often. All styles can be modified to meet your specifications. You can also create completely new styles if
   necessary.

   To add a style to the Output Styles submenu on the Tools menu:

      1. From the EndNote Tools menu, select Output Styles, and then select Open Style Manager.

      2. Find the style that you need.

      3. Click in the box to the left of the style's name to choose it as one of your favorites.

      4. Close the Style Manager by clicking the Close button or selecting Close Style Manager from the File
         menu in the Style Manager.

   To select a whole category of styles as favorites, click the Find By button in the Style Manager, select the
   category of interest, and then click Mark All when all of the styles for that category are displayed. Click the
   Find By button and select All Styles to bring all the styles back into view. The Unmark All button may be
   used to unmark all of the output styles that are showing in the list.

If You Cannot Find the Style You Need

   Many bibliographic styles are variants of a small number of well-known bibliographic formats. EndNote
   includes over 7,500 different styles, but it may not include the exact style you need. If you can't find the
   specific style you need, you can:

       ▪ Check the submission guidelines for the publication to see if the style is a derivative of a well-known
          style. You may be able to use that style (perhaps with minor modifications).

       ▪ Try the interactive Styles Finder on the EndNote site. A shortcut to the Web Styles Finder is provided
          as EndNote Output Styles on the Help menu.


Previewing Styles and Showing Information
   Click More Info in the Style Manager to show the information panel. (When you select More Info, the button
   changes to Less Info, which would hide the panel.) The information panel is used to display more detail
   about the selected style.

   Use the Style Info/Preview button to toggle between these displays:

       ▪ Style Information: Details about the style are displayed in the Information panel. These include the
          creation and modification dates, category, which style guide the style is based on, and any limitations
          or comments about using the style.

       ▪ Style Preview: In the preview section, EndNote shows how a journal, book, and book section would
          be formatted with the selected style.

Previewing Styles Using Your Own References

   EndNote uses built-in examples for the previews in the Style Manager window. If you want to preview a style
   using your own references:

      1. In the Style Manager, mark the style as a favorite by clicking in the checkbox next to its name. This
         adds the style to the Output Styles favorites list.

      2. From the Tools menu, select Output Styles, and select the style to preview.

      3. Open a library, select a reference, and then expand the Preview subpanel in the Reference
         Summary panel. See the preview subpanel section of The Summary Panel.

      4. Select any reference in your library to have it displayed in the Preview subpanel.

   The Preview panel displays only one reference at a time. If you would like to preview a group of references,
   you can use the Copy Formatted Reference command:

      1. From the Tools menu, select Output Styles and select a style.

      2. Select one or more references in your library and select Copy Formatted Reference (Ctrl+K) from the
         Edit menu.

      3. Paste (Ctrl+V) the formatted references into a word processor document to see them as they would
         appear in a bibliography.

   Or, use the Print Preview command from the File menu to show how the formatted references would look.

Copying Styles
   When you display a list of styles in EndNote, the list is comprised of the installed styles found in the C:
   \Program Files (x86)\EndNote 2025\Styles folder as well as new or modified styles found in your personal
   Styles folder. For an explanation of where your files are stored, see Folder Locations Preferences.

   Because each style is a separate file on your hard drive, you can copy them as you would copy any file on
   your hard drive using the File Explorer.

   To copy a style to a removable or network drive, select the style on your hard drive and drag it to the new
   location, or use the Copy (Ctrl+C) and Paste (Ctrl+V) commands. We recommend that you make a backup
   copy of any new or modified styles. (See Backing Up Your EndNote Files).

   To make a copy of a style from within EndNote:

      1. From the Tools menu, select Output Styles and select Open Style Manager.

      2. Select the style you want to copy and click Edit.

      3. Without making any changes to the file, select Save As from the style's File menu.

      4. Give this copy of the file a new name and Save it.

   The file is saved in your personal Styles folder. The new style will remain open. The original style will be left
   untouched.


Saving Styles
   To save a new style that you have just created, or to save changes to a style you have just modified, select
   Save or Save As from the style's File menu.

   If you have modified one of the styles EndNote originally installed, you must use Save As to save a copy to
   your personal Styles folder. If you have modified a style that is already located in your personal Styles folder,
   you can select either Save to directly modify the file, or Save As to make a copy with the changes. For a
   description of where your styles are stored, see Folder Locations Preferences.

   If you close a Style window before saving a style, EndNote prompts you to save or discard the changes you
   have made, or select Cancel to return to the style. If you quit from EndNote while a Style window is open,
   the same dialog appears.

   EndNote automatically saves new styles to your personal Styles folder. You may also specify a different
   folder if necessary. For instructions see Folder Locations Preferences.

   EndNote styles use the file name extension of ".ens" (for EndNote Style), as in "Nature.ens."


Deleting Styles
   To delete a style from EndNote:

      1. From the Tools menu, select Output Styles, and then select Open Style Manager.

      2. Select the style to be deleted.

      3. Right-click on the style and select Delete Style… from the menu, or press the Delete key.


       Page 460 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   You can also delete an unwanted style by switching to the File Manager, opening the appropriate Styles
   folder, and deleting the file (see Folder Locations Preferences).

    Note: You must have read/write access to the Styles folder in order to delete a style. If you do not have
    administrator access, you likely will not be able to delete a file located within the Program Files (x86)
    folder.


Renaming Styles
   Rename styles using the Save As command from the style's File menu. This allows you to make a copy of
   any style that you want to modify, so you can keep several variations of the same style. You can also
   rename styles by switching to the File Explorer, locating the style file in the Styles folder, clicking on the file
   name, and typing a new name.

   For an explanation of where your files are stored, see Folder Locations Preferences.


Reverting Changes to a Style
   If at any time you need to revert your changes back to the last saved copy of the style, select Revert Style…
   from the style's File menu. Once you close the Style window, or save the changes to a style, the changes
   are permanent until changed again.


Closing a Style
   To close a Style window, click the close button in the upper-right corner of the window, or select Close Style
   from the style's File menu. If you have not saved your changes to the style, EndNote prompts you and gives
   you the option to save or discard any changes that you have made.


What Should I Do if My Style Is Not Included?
   EndNote supplies over 7,500 styles for your convenience; however, because there are so many journals
   published, the style you need may not be included. This should not be a problem because you can
   customize a style of your own or edit any of EndNote’s preconfigured styles.

   If a style that you need is not included with EndNote, we recommend modifying a style that is similar to what
   you need. To download more of the predefined styles, see Installing Additional Output Styles.

   To find and modify a similar style:

      1. From the Tools menu, select Output Styles, and then select Open Style Manager.

      2. In the Style Manager, change the setting in the information panel from Style Info to Style Preview.
         The preview of the selected style should now be displayed.

      3. Scroll through the list of available styles to see if you can find one that is similar to what you need.

      4. Once you have found a similar style, select it, and click the Edit button. The Style window opens.

      5. From the style's File menu, select Save As, give this copy of the style a new name that corresponds
         to the name of the journal you want to use it for, and click Save. This will also keep the original style
         unchanged, in the event that you need to use it later.



       Page 461 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      6. The new Style window remains open for you to edit it as you need. For more details about editing
         parts of a style, read Modifying Style Templates and Additional Style Formatting Options.

   Once the new copy of the style has been saved, it will be added to your style menus.


Accessing Styles in Other Places
   The Style Manager displays only the styles found in specific folders. We recommend that you copy
   additional styles to your personal Styles folder.

   For an explanation of where your files are stored, or to change your personal Styles folder location, see
   Folder Locations Preferences.


Basic Components of a Style
   The best way to understand how a style works is to open one up and look at it.

       ▪ To create a new style: From the Tools menu, select Output Styles, and then select New Style. For
          more information on creating a new style, see Creating a New Style.

       ▪ To edit a style: From the Tools menu, select Output Styles, and then Open Style Manager. Select
          the style to edit and click Edit. The most recently used style can also be opened by selecting Output
          Styles from the Tools menu, and then selecting Edit "[recent style's name]."

The Style Window

   After choosing the option to edit an existing style or create a new one, EndNote opens the Style window.

   The options for editing a style are listed on the left side of the Style window. The first six items apply to
   citations, bibliographies, and citations in footnotes. They include:

       ▪ About This Style

       ▪ Punctuation

       ▪ Anonymous Works

       ▪ Page Numbers

       ▪ Journal Names

       ▪ Sections
   The other options in the Style window are grouped under one of following four headings.

         Citations: The items listed under the Citations heading apply only to citations in the body of
         the text.

         Bibliography: The items listed under the Bibliography heading apply to the bibliography that
         EndNote creates when you format a paper. These settings are also used with the Export, Print,
         Copy Formatted Reference, Subject Bibliography, and Preview features.




       Page 462 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


         Footnotes: The items under the Footnotes heading apply to citations that have been inserted
         into the footnotes or endnotes in a word-processing document. (You must first create the
         footnotes or endnotes in your word processor, and then insert EndNote citations into them.)

         Figures and Tables: The items under Figures and Tables apply to EndNote figures and tables
         that have been inserted into a Microsoft Word document.

   Click the plus/minus button next to one of the headings to expand or collapse the view, or to show or hide
   the related options. Click on an item under the headings to view the associated panel. You may switch
   between panels as needed while editing the file. No changes are saved in any of the panels, however, until
   you select Save or Save As from the style's File menu.

Style Templates

   The Citation, Bibliography, and Footnote sections of the style all have a Template panel and other options
   for fine tuning the style.

   The Templates panels are the major component of the styles. They include the field names and punctuation
   organized in the way EndNote should format the references for that particular style. The templates look like
   citations or bibliography entries, except that field names are used in place of the actual data. During the
   formatting process, EndNote replaces the field names with the corresponding information from the
   references.

   For details about working with style templates see Modifying Style Templates.

Other Style Options

   Under each heading in the Style window (Citations, Bibliography, and Footnotes) there are a series of
   options for how to fine-tune the formatted references in citations, bibliographies, or footnotes. Many of these
   options are repeated for the three sections (such as the settings that determine how author names are
   treated), because each of these three areas of the document might require a slightly different format. The
   Figures and Tables section applies specifically to EndNote figures and tables inserted into a Word
   document.


Modifying Style Templates
   If you are creating a bibliography that requires a style not included with EndNote, then you can modify a
   style to suit your needs. (See What Should I Do if My Style Is Not Included?) Editing a style requires a
   general understanding of how styles work and the components of a style. Read Basic Components of a
   Style to become familiar with the terms. These topics can help you in creating or modifying style templates:

       ▪ Citations Template

       ▪ Bibliography and Footnote Templates

       ▪ Changing the Punctuation in a Formatted Reference

       ▪ Adding and Removing Fields in a Formatted Reference

       ▪ Adding New Reference Types

       ▪ Fonts and Text in Output Styles

       ▪ Rules for Working with Style Templates

       Page 463 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      ▪ EndNote Cleans Up

      ▪ Special Formatting Characters

      ▪ Additional Style Formatting Options

Opening the Style Window
  To create or modify a style, you will first need to access the Style window by opening an existing style or
  creating a new style.

  To open a style for editing or create a new style:

      ▪ To create a new style: From the Tools menu, select Output Styles, and then select New Style. For
         more information on creating a new style, see Creating a New Style.

      ▪ To edit a style: From the Tools menu, select Output Styles, and then Open Style Manager. Select
         the style to edit and click Edit. The most recently used style can also be opened by selecting Output
         Styles from the Tools menu, and then selecting Edit "[recent style's name]."

  If you have opened an existing style, you will see a style window with options already set up, but ready for
  editing, with the style name at the top of the Style window. To save your customized version of the style,
  select Save As from the style's File menu.

  If you have created a new style, you will see Untitled Style at the top of the Style window until you save the
  file with a new name. To save the file, select Save As from the style's File menu.

  You can move between the Style window and other windows in EndNote by selecting the window of your
  choice from the Window menu in EndNote.


Citations Template
  To access the Citations template, first open a style for editing or create a new style.

     1. Select Output Styles from the Tools menu, then select one of the following options

           ▪ New Style to create a new style.

           ▪ Edit "[name of recently used style]" to open a style you have recently used for editing.

           ▪ Open Style Manager to access the list of styles installed on your computer, then select a style
               and click the Edit button.

     2. Then click Templates under the Citations heading.

  The Citations template tells EndNote how to format the in-text citations in the body of your paper. The most
  popular formats for in-text citations are (Author, Year), numbered, and Author (Year). For example:

      ▪ An (Author, Year) format displays "(Author, Year)" in the Citation area of the template. When you
         insert an in-text citation in your paper using this format, the citation would look like this example:

             (Binfield, 2008)




      Page 464 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       ▪ A numbered format displays "[Bibliography Number]" in the Citation area of the template. Numbered
          styles commonly enclose the bibliography number in brackets or parenthesis, or use a superscript
          number. Instead of (Binfield 2008) as your in-text citation, the citation would look like this example:

             [1] or (1) or 1

          The bibliography number corresponds to a numbered reference in your bibliography. If the same
          reference is inserted in the paper in more than one location, the same number will be used for that
          reference in each location. This differs from footnote or endnote styles, where a new number is used
          for each footnote or endnote.

       ▪ An Author (Year) format displays "Author (Year)" in the Citation — Author (Year) area of the template.
          When you insert an in-text citation in your paper using this format, the citation would look like this
          example:

             Binfield (2008)

   You may change the template by deleting unwanted field names or punctuation, retyping the punctuation
   you want, and inserting new fields with the Insert Field button. See Modifying Style Templates for
   information about editing templates.

    Note: Both the Citation and the Citation — Author (Year) area of the template must be completed in order
    to use the Author (Year) format in a paper.


Multiple Citation Separators

   Use the Multiple Citation Separators field to specify the punctuation to separate multiple citations in your
   papers. A multiple citation is an in-text citation that includes more than one reference within a single set of
   delimiters, such as: (Argus, 1993; Billoski, 1993; Hall, 1988). This example uses a semicolon and a space
   as the separator between citations.

   The separator can be changed by typing other text in the Multiple Citation Separator field. Remember to
   include a space in the separator section, when necessary.

Adding Additional Fields to In-Text Citations

   You can add other EndNote fields to the citation template. For example, If you would like EndNote to insert
   the journal name in the in-text citations of your paper, select the Journal/Secondary Title field from the Insert
   Field menu, as shown in the examples below.

       ▪ In the Citation area of the template, insert the Journal/Secondary Title field in the (Author, Year) field.
          For example: (Author, Journal/Secondary Title Year)

          When you insert an in-text citation in your paper, the citation would look like this example: (Porter,
          British Journal of Aesthetics 2009)

       ▪ In the Citation — Author (Year) area of the template, insert the Journal/Secondary Title field in the
          Author (Year) field. For example: Author, Journal/Secondary Title (Year)

          When you insert an in-text citation in your paper using this format, the citation would look like this
          example: Porter, British Journal of Aesthetics (2009)




       Page 465 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


    Note: The field names shown on the Insert Field list and in the Citations Template must always be the
    EndNote generic field names. If you try to enter a field name manually that is not a generic field name, it
    will be interpreted as text to be added to the citation.


Year Format

   If you would like EndNote to use 2-digit years (such as '09) in the in-text citations, check the Use 2-digit
   years option. Years from all centuries will be abbreviated to display just the last two digits. This applies only
   to the in-text citations.

    Note: The use of 2-digit years in citations is very rare now, but was common in the 20th century.


Bibliography and Footnote Templates
   If you have not yet done so, open the Style window for the style you wish to work with. (See Opening the
   Style Window.)

   Click Templates under the Bibliography or Footnotes heading in the Style window to see the templates for
   how those references are formatted.

   For footnote and bibliography templates, each has a Generic template, and other reference-type-specific
   templates to format the various reference types in a bibliography.

   The following examples show how journal articles, books, and book sections, respectively, would be
   formatted with the Numbered style. Notice that each reference type is formatted differently, which is why
   different templates are required:

            of mirror imaging. Behavioural Processes, 2020. 177: p. 8.

       2.   Pepperberg, I.M., The Alex studies: Cognitive and communicative
            abilities of grey parrots. 1999, Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University
            Press. 434.

            Editors. 2009, Springer-Verlag Berlin: Berlin. p. 109-123.

Generic Template

   The Generic template is used to format references that use the Generic reference type or do not have their
   own template in the style. For example, if a Book template had not been included in the style, book
   references would be formatted using the Generic template.

Generic — Short Form Template

   The Generic — Short Form template may be defined for each reference type just like the regular footnote.
   You can edit the short form in a template. The order of use is that:

      1. The short form definition for a specific reference is used.

      2. If the definition is not available, then the generic short form definition is used.


       Page 466 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      3. If no generic definition is available, then the full form of the reference for that type is used.

      4. If the full form is not available, then the generic full form is used.

Other Reference Type Templates

   The rest of the templates in the style tell EndNote how to format specific reference types, such as journals,
   books, and book sections. If a check mark appears next to a reference type in the Reference Type list, a
   template is already defined for it (you can edit the template).

Footnote Template Options

   Styles have varying requirements for how citations in footnotes should be formatted. The options at the top
   of the Footnotes Templates panel in the Style window allow for the different conditions.

       ▪ For some styles, citations in footnotes are formatted just like in-text citations (in the body of the
          paper). In that case, there is no need to create a special template for footnotes; select the Same as
          citation option from the Format citations in footnotes list.

       ▪ Similarly, some formats request that citations in footnotes are formatted as full bibliographic
          references, exactly like the bibliography. For those styles, set the Format citations in footnotes option
          to Same as Bibliography.

       ▪ However, if you need the footnotes to use their own special format (most styles for the humanities
          require this), you would set the Format citations in footnotes option to Using footnote format to format
          citations in footnotes with a unique footnote format. For this option, you need to define the templates
          for how citations in footnotes should be formatted.

   For information about how to treat repeated citations, such as using a short form for nonconsecutive
   repeated citations, and Ibid. for consecutive repeated citations, see Repeated Citations in Footnotes.

   For repeated citations, select the checkbox that tells the system to include the Title field only when needed
   to disambiguate a citation in the short form.


Changing the Punctuation in a Formatted Reference
   If you have not yet done so, open the Style window for the style you wish to work with. (See Opening the
   Style Window.) For this example, open the Numbered style.

   Punctuation that appears in your formatted references can be changed by editing the style you are using.
   When you edit a style, you can delete unwanted punctuation, replace it with other punctuation, or add
   additional punctuation where necessary.

   For example, if the Numbered style creates a perfect bibliography for your document except that it puts a
   comma after the authors’ names where you need a period, you can edit the Numbered style to make this
   change.

   To edit the Numbered style:

      1. Open the Numbered style. (See Opening the Style Window.)

      2. Click the Templates option under the Bibliography heading.




       Page 467 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


     3. For each reference type (such as Generic, Journal Article, and Book), delete the comma that follows
        the field name Author and type a period.

         The style’s bibliographic templates should now look like the example below. Notice that the
         punctuation after the Author field in each template has been changed to a period.




     4. From the style's File menu, select Save As. In the dialog that appears, enter a new name for this
        modified Numbered style, and then click Save.

  Now you can use the new style to create a formatted bibliography that puts a period between the author
  names and the titles.

  For information about making punctuation or spaces appear only under certain circumstances see Special
  Formatting Characters. That topic explains the use of the nonbreaking spaces (°), vertical bars (|), accent
  grave (`), and the carets (^) that you see in the style templates.

   Note: If you save a new style into a folder other than your personal Styles folder, it will not be available in
   the Style Manager. You should save new styles to your Styles folder, or change Folder Locations
   Preferences if necessary.


Adding and Removing Fields in a Formatted Reference
  If you have not yet done so, open the Style window for the style you wish to work with. (See Opening the
  Style Window.)

  The field names (such as Author, Year, and Title) that you see when editing a style template indicate what
  information is included in your formatted reference. If you want to include a field, such as Notes, along with
  your references, you should add the Notes field to the style that you use. Similarly, to exclude unwanted
  information that is appearing in a bibliography, you must delete the field name that contains that information
  from the style’s bibliography template.

  The examples below show two common scenarios in which fields are added to or removed from the
  formatted bibliography. Whenever you change the fields in a style template be sure to check the surrounding
  punctuation to make sure that it is still accurate.


      Page 468 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


Adding a Field to a Style Template

   To insert a new field into a style template:

      1. Click on the Templates option under the Bibliography heading, and position the cursor at the location
         in the template where you want to add a field.

      2. Click the Insert Field button and select the field to be added.

      3. After the field is inserted, add any punctuation or spacing that is necessary to correctly incorporate
         the new field into the style.

    Note: As a short-cut, you can use the options in the Layout panel to add text or punctuation before or
    after every reference in a bibliography. See Bibliography Layout.


Deleting a Field from a Style Template

   If EndNote includes information in your bibliography that you do not want to be there, you can edit the style
   and delete the unwanted field’s name and any associated punctuation.

   For example, if a style includes the issue number in your journal references, and you do not want the issue
   to appear:

      1. Under the Bibliography heading, click the Templates option.

      2. Select the text to be deleted (for example, ". Issue|"), and press the Delete or Backspace key.

   Along with the Issue field, also remove the space and period that precede it and the vertical bar, a special
   formatting character that follows the Issue field. (See Special Formatting Characters for more information
   about the vertical bar.)


Adding New Reference Types
   If you have not yet done so, open the Style window for the style you wish to work with. (See Opening the
   Style Window.)

   When a style does not include a template for a specific reference type, such as Report, EndNote uses the
   style’s Generic template to format that reference type. Although there are times when the Generic format
   suffices, often it is not sufficient because the other reference types need to be formatted differently.
   Therefore, you should make specific templates for the different reference types that you will be including in
   your bibliographies.

   To add a new reference type template to a style:

      1. In the Style window, click the Templates panel under the Bibliography heading.

      2. Select the name of the desired reference type from the Reference Types drop-down menu .
         (Reference Types that are already defined appear in the list with checkmarks next to their name.)

   An empty new template for that reference type is added at the bottom of the Style window (scroll to the
   bottom of the Style window if you do not see it).

Defining the Format for the New Reference Type Template

   Defining the format for a new template is a process of inserting the necessary fields and punctuation in the
   correct order. For this example, we want a report to look like this (Author, Title, Report Number. Year,
   Institution: City.):

   We can insert the fields and type the punctuation to create a template for the Report reference type. Use the
   Insert Field button at the top of the Style window to insert the fields in the correct order. After inserting a field
   name, type the punctuation and spacing that should follow it. Apply text styles, such as italics for the Title,
   by selecting the text to change and using the Style toolbar.

   The final template for the Report reference type looks like this:

       Report
       Author,·Title,·Report·Number.·Year,·Institution:·City.

A Faster way to set up a new Reference Type Template

   If there is another reference type template that is very close to the one you want to create, copy and paste
   the contents of that template into the new template you created. EndNote will automatically replace the field
   names from the original template with the the equivalent fields for the new reference type. Next, proofread
   the fields to be sure they are correct and change any fields or punctuation, as needed. If needed, delete
   incorrect fields and use Insert Field to insert any needed fields into the template.


Fonts and Text in Output Styles
   By default, text entered into a Style window appears in EndNote’s Plain Font, Plain Size, and Plain Style
   settings, which allow the bibliography that EndNote creates to adopt to your word processor's Normal style
   settings in your paper. For example, if you type your paper in 10-point Times New Roman font by manually
   selecting the text and setting it to 10-point Times New Roman font, but the Normal style in your document is
   set to use 14-point Arial font, EndNote would use the 14-point Arial font for the paper’s bibliography.

   You can use the Edit menu or the Style toolbar to apply any font, size, or text style to your Style templates to
   override the default setting for specific fields that might require it, but it is generally better to use the Plain
   settings. (Note that only the standard Windows fonts are available.)

   All text attributes entered into a style template will carry over into the bibliography that EndNote creates. You
   can use this feature, for example, to italicize titles or make the volume numbers bold. Any font or text style
   changes entered in an EndNote Reference window will carry through the bibliography as well. For example,
   any italicized terms in your references will still appear italicized in your bibliography, regardless of the text
   attributes that the EndNote bibliographic style applies.

To Apply Bold, Italic, or Underline Styles to Fields or Text

      1. Select the field or text to be formatted.

      2. Choose the formatting option from the toolbar in the Style window, or select the option from the
         Font submenu in the style's Edit menu..

      3. Use the following shortcuts.

           ▪ Ctrl+B for bold

           ▪ Ctrl+I for italic

       Page 470 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


           ▪ Ctrl+U for underline

           ▪ Ctrl+Shift++ (the last + is the plus sign, so this means to hold down the Ctrl key, the Shift key, and
              the + key together) for superscript

           ▪ Ctrl+Shift+‒ (the ‒ is the minus sign, so this means to hold down the Ctrl key, the Shift key, and
              the ‒ key together) for subscript

To Change the Font for Selected Text

   Some styles require a different font to be used for some fields, usually the Title field. In these cases, the
   style must include a font change for just those fields that require it. To change the font for a specific field:

      1. Select the field to be formatted.

      2. From the style's Edit menu, select the font you need from the Font drop-down list. The default will
         show as Plain Font.

    Note: If text is italicized in the library, then the field is italicized by the style, that text will still appear in
    italics in the formatted references. EndNote cannot reverse the italics in a field to plain text when the field
    is italicized in the style.


Rules for Working with Style Templates
   There are four basic rules of dependence that govern how text, spaces, and field names influence each
   other when they are used in a style template. If necessary, these rules can be circumvented in specific
   situations using the special formatting characters described in the next section of this chapter.

    Note: The middle dot (·) character indicates a space in examples.


Rule #1: Basic Dependence

   Any text or punctuation that is not separated from a field by an ordinary space is dependent on the adjacent
   field.

   In this context, "dependent" means that the text or punctuation adjacent to a field only appears in your
   bibliography if the adjacent field contains data. For example, in this excerpt:

       Volume·(Issue)

   the parentheses around "Issue" only appear in a formatted reference if there is an issue number for the
   reference.

Rule #2: The Preceding Field Takes Precedence over the Following Field

   When punctuation appears between two fields with no intervening spaces, it is dependent on the preceding
   field.
   In this example:

       Volume:Issue




       Page 471 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   the colon is dependent on the Volume field. This means if there is no volume in the reference, the colon will
   not appear. If there is a volume, the colon will appear.

    Note: This example shows a case where the rules of dependence might not do what you want. For
    example, you might want to have the colon only show when there is an issue. This can be done using the
    Forced Separation character. See Special Formatting Characters.


Rule #3: The First Space after a Field Is Dependent on That Field; Additional Spaces Are
Independent

   The first ordinary space following a field is always dependent on that field. Any consecutive spaces after that
   are independent and will always appear in the formatted references.

   For example, if EndNote formats an anonymous book using a template that has the Author field followed by
   a space and the Title field:

       Author.·Title

   the title will not be preceded by a space in the final formatted reference because the space, just like the
   period, is dependent on the Author field. However, if the style includes two spaces between the Author and
   the Title:

    Author.··Title

   the title will be preceded by one space for all anonymous references. The first space, being dependent on
   the Author field, disappears when there is no author, however the second space is independent, so it
   remains in the formatted reference.

   Independent spaces can be forced to be dependent on an adjacent field using the special formatting
   characters.

Rule #4: Independent Text Always Appears in the Bibliography

   Any text or punctuation that is not dependent on a field name always appears in the formatted references.
   For example, if:

       Edition·ed.

   is entered into a style’s Book template using only an ordinary space to separate the text "ed." and the field
   "Edition" the text "ed." will appear in all Book references—regardless of whether or not there is an edition for
   that reference.

    Note: The nonbreaking space can be used in place of a regular space to link independent text to a field.
    See Special Formatting Characters.


Special Formatting Characters
   EndNote has special formatting characters that add flexibility and precision to the grouping of punctuation
   and fields in the style templates.

    Note: Special characters appear in this color font here to make them more visible, but in the standard
    black font in EndNote. Regular spaces are indicated by the dot (·) character.


       Page 472 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


Link Adjacent Text (Using the Nonbreaking Space)

   If you type "Edition ed." into a style template and use an ordinary space to separate the field name "Edition"
   from the abbreviation "ed.", then "ed." will appear regardless of whether or not the reference has an edition
   (see Rule #4: Independent Text Always Appears in the Bibliography).

   To avoid this problem, make "ed." dependent on the Edition field by linking "ed." to the Edition field with a
   nonbreaking space. Think of a nonbreaking space as bibliographic formatting glue. It joins two or more
   items together so they act as a single unit. Thus, any text or punctuation "glued" to a field will drop out of the
   bibliography if that field is empty.

   You can insert a nonbreaking space by selecting Link Adjacent Text from the Insert Field list in the
   Templates panels. You can also enter it by typing Ctrl+Alt+Space. It appears on the screen as a degree (°)
   character.

   The nonbreaking space is converted to a normal space in the formatting process. Common uses of the
   nonbreaking space include (where "°" is used as a nonbreaking space):

       p^pp°Pages
       Edition°ed.
       vol°Volume
       Editor°Ed.^Eds.

   The nonbreaking space is also used in conjunction with the vertical bar (see below) to change the
   dependency of a punctuation mark from one field to another.

       Volume|:°Issue|.

   In this case, the colon (:) is linked to the Issue field with a nonbreaking space, so it does not print in the
   bibliography if the Issue field is empty.

Forced Separation—Using the Vertical Bar

   If you do not want text or punctuation to be dependent on the preceding or adjacent field, use the vertical
   bar character (|), to force a separation of the text from a field. The vertical bar can be found on the same key
   as the backslash (\). It can also be inserted from the Insert Field list in the Templates panels.

   Think of a vertical bar as breaking dependence, or forcing separation between two dependent items. (The
   vertical bar works in exactly the opposite way as the nonbreaking space.)

   For example, the Journal Article templates in some styles require a period between the volume and issue. A
   template for such a style might look like this (where "·" indicates a space):

       Journal Article
       Author.·"Title."·Journal·Volume.Issue·(Year):·Pages.

   However, when this style formats a journal article that does not include an issue number, the bibliography
   entry will be incorrect, as in the following example:

       Clark, H. and Carlson, T. "Hearers and Speech Acts." Language 58.(1982):
       332-373.

   Notice that the period used to separate the volume from the issue appears here in the absence of an issue
   because it is dependent upon the Volume (Rule #2). And the space separating the volume and the year is
   lost because that space is dependent upon the Issue field (Rule #3).


       Page 473 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   EndNote has a way of avoiding these problems. The vertical bar character (|) can be used to break the
   automatic grouping of spaces and punctuation with adjacent fields.

   If you insert the vertical bar before the period in our example, the period’s dependency switches from the
   Volume field to the Issue field. Add another vertical bar before the space that follows the Issue field, and the
   space will no longer be dependent on the Issue field. Use the vertical bar character in conjunction with the
   nonbreaking space. With these changes the style looks like this:

       Journal Article
       Author.·"Title."·Journal·Volume|.Issue|·(Year)|:°Pages|.

   And the formatted reference without an issue is correct:

       Clark, H. and Carlson, T. "Hearers and Speech Acts." Language 58 (1982):
       332-373.

   Other common examples for using the vertical bar include:

       Publisher|:°City
       Pages|. (to make the final period independent of the field before it)

Field Names in Bibliographies

   Sometimes you may need to use text in a template that is also an EndNote field name for that reference
   type. For example, you may want to use the word "Editor" after the editor’s name:

       Jones, V.R., B.K. Marion, and R.L. Zeiss, The Theory of Foraging, in A
       History of Foraging Behavior, B.J. Bloggs, Editor. 1976, Smith and Barnes:
       New York.

   Normally, EndNote interprets the word "Editor" as a field name when it appears in a book’s style template.
   This is true even of field names that appear as part of a word, such as "Editors" or "Issued." Field names
   need not be capitalized to be recognized.

   To force EndNote to interpret a word as just text and not as a field name in a template, put an accent grave
   character (`) before and after the word: `Editor`. The accent grave is found in the upper left corner of most
   keyboards, on the same key as the tilde (~). Remember to also use the nonbreaking space to link the text,
   `Editor`, to the Editor field.

       Book Section
       Author,·Title|.°in°Book·Title|,°Editor,°`Editor`^`Editors`|.·Year,·Publisher
       |:°City|,·p.°Pages|.

Singular/Plural Term Separator (Caret ^)

   You can specify both singular and plural forms of labels for editors or pages in a formatted reference by
   using a caret (^) to separate the terms. For example, some styles put "Ed." after a single editor and "Eds."
   after several editors’ names. Or, similarly, "p." might precede a single page, while "pp." precedes multiple
   pages. This feature can be applied to any field that corresponds to the Generic field for Author, Secondary
   Author, Tertiary Author, Subsidiary Author, Translated Author, Pages, or Cited Pages.

   In the style template, enter both the singular and plural forms of the label separated by a caret (insert it from
   the Insert Field list or type Shift+6). Any text before the caret, back to but not including the preceding space,
   is used for the singular form; text after the caret, up to the next space, is used for the plural form. These



       Page 474 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


  terms must also be linked to the relevant field using a nonbreaking space. For example, a style template
  might look like this:

      Edited Book
      Editor,°ed.^eds.·Title.·Number·of·Volumes°vols|.°Vol.°Volume|,·Series·Title
      |.·City|:°Publisher|,°Year|.

  Or like this:

      Journal Article
      Author.·"Title,"·Journal,·Volume|.°Issue|·(Year)|:p.^pp.°Pages|.

   Note: Spaces in EndNote style templates appear as small dots (·), as they do here. They are not special
   characters, they are shown this way here and in EndNote to make it easy to identify spaces in the style.
   Spaces show as dots in EndNote only when working in the style templates, not in other parts of the style.


EndNote Cleans Up
  Too confused about all these rules? Well, even if you don’t get everything quite right according to the rules,
  EndNote will do its best to clean up the formatted reference. Obvious problems are fixed automatically.

  Normally, field text is entered into EndNote without ending punctuation, so that the selected output style can
  supply punctuation as required by that particular style. However, when you download references from
  various sources, some information providers may include punctuation.

  For example, when an output style directs EndNote to insert a period after a field, EndNote must determine
  what to do with any punctuation that already exists at the end of the field in the reference.

       Punctuation found, plus punctuation
                                                       Replaced with:
       added by the output style:

       spaces, period                                  period

       comma, period (,.)                              period

       semicolon, period (;.)                          period

       colon, period (:.)                              period

       double periods (..)                             single period

       question mark, period (?.)                      question mark

       exclamation point, period (!.)                  exclamation point

  One set of punctuation that is never replaced is the period, comma (.,) because it may be used for
  abbreviations like ed., et al., etc.


Additional Style Formatting Options
  Templates determine the general layout of the formatted references and citations (see Modifying Style
  Templates). The remainder of the panels in the Style window can be used to fine-tune certain aspects of a
  bibliographic style. See the following topics for more information:

Punctuation in Output Styles
  Style guides in some regions require a space before the colon (and other punctuation marks) in the
  formatting of references. Other style guides do not.

  Select either English or French in the Punctuation option in the output style. The default selection is English.

  The English option tells EndNote to remove extra spaces before the following punctuation marks. Spaces
  before other punctuation marks and symbols are retained.

      ▪ Colon (:)

      ▪ Semicolon (;)

      ▪ Exclamation mark (!)

      ▪ Question mark (?)
  The French option tells EndNote that a space is required before and after the following punctuation marks.

      ▪ Colon (:)

      ▪ Semicolon (;)

      ▪ Chevrons (<< >>) (opening and closing)

      ▪ Exclamation mark (!)

      ▪ Question mark (?)

      ▪ Percent sign (%)

      ▪ Dollar sign ($)

      ▪ Pound sign (#)

Anonymous Works
  Anonymous works are defined by EndNote as references where the Author field is blank (not "Anonymous").
  The settings in the Anonymous Works panel applies to the in-text citations and bibliography templates.

  Open styles for editing by selecting Tools > Output Styles > Open Style Manager, selecting a style, and then
  clicking Edit.

  Leave Author Blank: The author section of the formatted reference is left empty. If the references are to be
  sorted by author names, the anonymous works would be sorted at the top of the list because they have no
  author.

  Use Full Title in Place of Author: Where the author would have appeared, the title is used instead. If the
  references are sorted by author, the anonymous references will be sorted as though the title were the
  author.

  Use Short Title in Place of Author: Where the author would have appeared, the short title is used instead.
  If the references are sorted by author, the anonymous references will be sorted as though the short title
  were the author. If EndNote encounters a reference that does not have anything entered into the Short Title
  field, it uses the contents of the regular Title field instead.

  Use APA Specifications: The American Psychological Association format (used by many journals) requires
  a special variation of the Use Title in Place of Author option.

  Insert Text: The text that you enter here appears in the author’s place in the formatted reference, and it is
  used for sorting purposes if the references are to be sorted by author names. Commonly this text would be
  something like the word "Anonymous" or "Anon."


Page Numbers
  The Page Numbers panel allows you to specify how the page numbers should be formatted in your
  references.

      ▪ Don’t change page numbers
         The contents of the Pages field are used directly in the formatted reference. No changes are made.

      ▪ Show only the first page number
         Only the first characters in the Pages field are included in the bibliography. For example, "123-125"
         in the Pages field becomes "123" in the formatted reference.

      ▪ Abbreviate the last page number
         Any digits of the last page number that are the same as the first page number are eliminated. For
         example, "123-125" in the Pages field becomes "123-5" in the formatted reference.

      ▪ Abbreviate the last page, keeping two digits
         Any digits of the last page number that are the same as the first page number are eliminated, down
         to a minimum of two digits. For example, "123-125" in the Pages field becomes "123-25" in the
         formatted reference.

      ▪ Show the full range of pages
         Leading digits are added to the last page number so the full page range is used. For
         example, "123-5" in the Pages field becomes "123-125" in the formatted reference.

      ▪ Show only the first page for Journals, full range for others
         Journal articles are formatted differently from other types of references.

  There is also an option to separate page numbers and date ranges with either an en dash (–) or a hyphen
  (-). En dashes are generally preferred between number and date ranges by publishers, so this is the default
  when creating a new style.

   Note: Special Formatting Characters describes how to instruct EndNote to add text such as "p." vs. "pp.",
   or "page" vs. "pages" to the formatted references using the caret (^).

Journal Names
  Different journals have different standards for abbreviating journal names. For example, some styles may
  require "Proceedings of the National Academy of Science" to be abbreviated as "Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci.,"
  "P.N.A.S.," or "PNAS." EndNote’s Journals term list provides a way for you store up to four variations of
  journal names (the full name and three forms of abbreviations) to be used in your bibliographies.

  The Journals term list that is created for every library is automatically linked to the Journal and Alternate
  Journal fields, and therefore it is ready to be used with the Journal Names options. You need to be sure that
  the necessary information is in the Journals term list, and that your style is set up to use the correct form of
  the journal name.

  If your Journals term list includes the name of the journal as it is entered in your EndNote references, and
  the form of the journal name that you would like to appear in your bibliographies, you may set your
  preference in a style to have EndNote substitute a form of the name in the Journals term list for what was
  entered into your references.

  EndNote provides fourteen predefined journal abbreviation lists for different disciplines (including medicine,
  chemistry, and humanities). If you are interested in using one of these lists, you may import it into your
  Journals term list (see Loading Supplied Journal Abbreviations) and set up a bibliographic style to use one
  of the abbreviations for the formatted bibliography. If EndNote does not provide a journal term list that
  applies to your area of research, you may also enter the journal abbreviations yourself. See Important
  Points About Entering Journal Names.

  If you have not yet done so, open the Style window for the style you wish to work with. (See Opening the
  Style Window.)

  To modify a style to use the abbreviations in a Journals term list:

     1. Select the Journal Names panel from the list at the left of the Style window to see the available
        options:

          ▪ Use Full Journal Name
             When creating a bibliography, EndNote replaces the Journal name in the reference with the form
             of that name in the first column of the Journals term list. This first column is normally used for full
             names.

          ▪ Abbreviation 1
             Abbreviation 2
             Abbreviation 3
             In the bibliography, the journal name for each reference is replaced with the form of that name in
             the second, third, or fourth column of the Journals term list, respectively.

          ▪ Don’t Replace
             In the bibliography, EndNote uses the journal name exactly as it appears in the reference in the
             EndNote library. No changes are made.

          ▪ Abbreviate Journal Articles Only
             The substitutions made with the Journal Names option can apply to all Secondary Title fields, or
             to the Secondary Title field for only the Journal Article reference type. If this option is unchecked,
             EndNote applies this feature to all reference types, EndNote also abbreviates fields such as
             Conference Name, and the names of magazines and newspapers.

          ▪ Remove Periods
             Select this option to have EndNote eliminate the periods from all journal names in the
             bibliography that it is creating, regardless of the abbreviation being used. This option does not

      Page 479 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


             require that the journal names be in the Journals term list. For example, if the journal names are
             entered into your references using periods, and you do not have a Journals term list that includes
             the names without periods, you can still just check this option and the periods will be stripped out
             of the journal names when EndNote formats a bibliography.

   If a journal name is not found in the specified column of the Journals term list, the style uses the journal
   name as it appears in the Reference window. No replacement is made for that journal.

   The default setting is Don’t Replace. EndNote uses the journal name exactly as it appears in the original
   reference.

    Note: None of these changes actually takes place in the EndNote library. These options only determine
    what information goes into the bibliography that is generated using the Copy Formatted Reference, Print,
    Export, and Format Bibliography commands.


Sections Options in Output Styles
   EndNote has always created a single bibliography at the end of your word processor documents. That is still
   true when you Cite While You Write in Pages, OpenOffice Writer documents, or format RTF files. However,
   EndNote includes additional output style options specifically for Microsoft Word.

   You can choose to:

       ▪ Create a complete bibliography at the end of each document (the default setting for almost all of the
          supplied output styles).

       ▪ Create a bibliography for each section in the document (as defined in the styles APA 5th and 6th
          (sections)).

       ▪ Create a bibliography for each section and also a complete bibliography at the end of the document.
   For more information about using sections in a Microsoft Word document, see Creating Multiple
   Bibliographies in a Single Document.

    Note: The Sections portion of an output style is ignored by Pages, OpenOffice Writer, and when
    formatting RTF files.


Create a complete bibliography at the end of each document

   This default setting formats a single bibliography at the end of a document. Even if you have broken the
   document into multiple sections, a single bibliography will appear at the end of the document.

Create a bibliography for each section in the document

   When you select this option, a bibliography is created at the end of each section, and includes only the
   citations within a section.

   An additional checkbox is available for sections: Continue numbering, or apply settings for disambiguation
   and repeated citations across sections.

       ▪ When the checkbox is blank:



       Page 480 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


          ▪ When a numbered bibliographic style is selected, citation numbering will be restarted at the
             beginning of each section.

          ▪ When a numbered bibliographic style is not selected, ambiguous citation settings will be
             restarted and applied to each section individually. For more information about ambiguous citation
             settings, see Ambiguous Citations.

      ▪ When the checkbox is selected:

          ▪ When a numbered style is selected, selecting the check box will assure that numbering is
             continued across sections. For example, if citations in the first section are numbered 1 to 10,
             citations in the next section will start with number 11.

          ▪ When a numbered style is not selected, ambiguous citation settings will apply across the entire
             document. For more information about ambiguous citation settings, see Ambiguous Citations.

      ▪ When Create a bibliography for each section and a complete bibliography at the end of the
         document is selected:

          ▪ This option creates a bibliography for each section as well as a complete bibliography of all the
             citations in the document.

          ▪ When a numbered style is selected, citation numbering continues sequentially across all
             sections, without restarting for each section.

          ▪ When a numbered style is not selected, ambiguous citation settings are applied across the entire
             document, without restarting for each section.

          ▪ If a document is not divided into sections, EndNote formats a single, complete bibliography at
             the end of the document.


Ambiguous Citations
  With in-text citations like (Smith, 1995) or (Smith 246-9), references can have identical in-text citations if
  they are by the same author or the authors have the same last name. This leads to ambiguity in the citations
  that would make it impossible for the reader of your paper to know to which reference by Smith you are
  referring. EndNote provides various ways to avoid this sort of ambiguity in your citations.

  Any combination of the following options may be used. Click in the checkbox next to all options that apply.
  Note that these settings assume the author is used in the in-text citation. They are not relevant for styles
  that use bibliography numbers for the in-text citations as it is not possible to have ambiguous citations when
  they are uniquely numbered.

      ▪ Include author initials in citation
         Check this option to have EndNote include initials with author names to distinguish between citations
         by different authors that happen to have the same surname. Select how the initials should appear
         from the Initials option in the section. For example, the MLA style uses just author names and page
         numbers in citations. Initials are added to clarify which Smith wrote the cited reference:

             (S. Smith 241-5) and (L. Smith 12-20)

      ▪ List more authors until citation is unique
         Some styles request that only a fixed number of authors be listed in the in-text citation, and then "et


      Page 481 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


          al." or "and others" is inserted to indicate that the author list was abbreviated. Select this option if you
          would like EndNote to list additional authors to make the citation unique. For example, if the in-text
          citations were set to list only 3 authors, and you have two references in which the first three authors
          are the same, EndNote would add a fourth author to the citations, and continue in that manner until
          the list of authors was different between the two citations.

       ▪ Add the title for different works by the same author(s)
          If you have two works by the same author, it won’t help to add initials or list more authors to
          differentiate the two. In this case, some styles request that the title of the reference (or a shortened
          form of the title) be added to the in-text citation. If you choose this option and select the Short Title
          option, EndNote includes the contents of the Short Title field when available. Otherwise, it uses the
          full title. The format of the title is taken directly from the bibliography. This is an example in the MLA
          style, which normally includes only the author and page number in a citation:

              (Smith, History of Our Times 35)
              (Smith, Looking Forward 77)

       ▪ Add a letter after the year
          For citations in an (Author, Year) format, EndNote can add a letter to the year to make citations from
          the same author published in the same year distinguishable from each other. The letter appended to
          the year will appear in both the in-text citations and references in the bibliography.

              (Smith 1995a)
              (Smith 1995b)


Numbering Citations in Output Styles
   The settings in the citation Numbering panel apply only when "Bibliography Number" is used in the Citation
   template (see Citations Template). This creates uniquely numbered citations in the text of the paper; the
   numbers correspond to entries in the bibliography. For papers formatted with a numbered style, these
   options are relevant to multiple citations grouped within one set of citation delimiters. For example:

       Unformatted citation: {Keys, 1998 #93; Jen, 1996 #88}
       Formatted citation: (1, 2) or [1, 2] or 1, 2

Use Number Ranges for Consecutive Citations

   When this option is checked, consecutive bibliography numbers appearing in a multiple citation are joined
   by a single hyphen, for example:

       …as shown by the Berkeley studies conducted in 20153-6 and 20171, 7.

Grouped References

   The Grouped Reference option allows you to cite with one number any references that always appear
   together in the paper as multiple citations. The citations are not given their own numbers, but rather one
   number is used both in the text and the bibliography to identify the whole group of citations. With this setting,
   you also have the option to specify how the grouped references in the bibliography should be separated.

   This option shows a semicolon and a space as a separator:

   To define a composite citation:

      1. Select the box to Use letters to separate grouped references.

      2. Use the Present letters in list to select Lowercase or Uppercase letters.

      3. Select the appropriate letter format for in-text formatted citations. The examples shown in EndNote
         illustrate how letters and numbers appear for consecutive citations and ranges.

           ▪ (1a, 1b), (1a, 1b, 2a-c)
              The number always appears with a stand-alone letter or with the first letter of a range. This is the
              default setting.

           ▪ (1a, b), (1a, b, 2a-c)
              Only the letter of the first citation of the composite is preceded with the number.

           ▪ (1a, b), (1a, 1b, 2a-c)
              The letter of the first citation of the composite is preceded with a number; additional letters
              include a number only if there could be ambiguity.

           ▪ (1a, 1b), (1a, 1b, 2a-2c)
              Letters are always preceded by a number.

      4. Use the “Precede by” and “Follow by” boxes to enter any character(s) that you want to surround the
         letter in the bibliography.


Author Lists in the Bibliography and Footnotes
   The Author Lists panels under the Bibliography and Footnotes headings let you specify exactly how the
   authors are to appear in the formatted bibliographic references or in your footnotes. You can format author
   names differently in the footnotes and bibliography, so be sure that you check the Author Lists settings


       Page 483 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   under all these headings to adjust settings. The settings in these panels apply to all reference types
   formatted with the current style.

    Note: In the example text below, dots (·) are used to indicate where a space should be added in the style.
    These dots will not appear in EndNote's Author Lists panels, spaces will appear instead. They are added
    here only to make spacing clearly recognizable.


Separators Between Author Names

   In the "Author Separators" box, enter any punctuation and spaces that separate the individual author names
   in a citation or bibliographic reference. In references with multiple authors, it is standard to separate the
   names with a comma and a space.

       ▪ Use the between box to enter a comma and a space or any other required punctuation.

       ▪ Use the before last box to enter the separator that appears before the last author in a reference.
          Sometimes this is something other than a comma and a space, such as ",·and·" or an ampersand
          (&) followed by a space.

   Normally only the first row in the Author Separators box is used (with the range of authors set at "1 to 100")
   so that the separators in that row apply to all of the authors cited in a reference. However, there are styles in
   which two authors are listed as "Smith and Jones" (without a comma), and more than two are listed as
   "Smith, Jones, and Johnson" (with a comma before the word "·and·"). In this case, make "·and·" the
   "before last" separator when there are only two authors; and enter ",·and·" when there are 3 or more
   authors.

    Note: Include spaces before and after the word "and" and a space after commas.


Abbreviating the Author List

   Some journals require that you abbreviate the list of authors, using "et al." or an equivalent, after a certain
   number of authors. The Abbreviated Author List section of the Author List panel allows you to specify the
   number of authors needed to trigger this abbreviation, how many authors to include in the formatted
   reference, and what the abbreviation should be.

       ▪ List all author names
          Select this option if you do not want to abbreviate the author lists.

       ▪ If ___ or more authors, list the first ___ author(s) and abbreviate with ___
          Select this option and fill in the blanks with the appropriate numbers and text (such as ",·et al.") if
          you would like the list of authors abbreviated.

APA Author List Setting

   In the Author List settings for bibliographies there is a setting within the Abbreviated Author List settings that
   is sometimes referred to as the "APA setting." For the APA 6th and 7th styles, this option includes the
   following settings:

       ▪ For APA 6th: If 8 or more authors, list the first 6 authors, insert … and add the last author's name.

       ▪ For APA 7th: If 21 or more authors, list the first 19 authors, insert … and add the last author's name.

       Page 484 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   This setting allows you to display a set number of author names (or editor names for the Edited
   Book reference type) followed by an ellipsis (…), followed by the last author name (or editor name for the
   Edited Book reference type). This option is already set up for the APA styles included with EndNote, but you
   can also use it for other styles based on the APA style, if needed.

For Subsequent Works by the Same Author

   In some bibliographic styles, if there is more than one work by an author (or group of authors), the first
   appearance of that author name is formatted differently from subsequent works. For example, the first
   reference might list the full author name, while subsequent references display a line of dashes in place of
   the author name.

   You can print the entire author list for each reference, completely leave out the author list for subsequent
   works, or replace repeated author lists with a text string.

Abbreviated Author List — Short Form (footnotes only)

       ▪ List all author names
          Select this option if you do not want to abbreviate the author lists.

       ▪ If ___ or more authors, list the first ___ author(s) and abbreviate with ___
          Select this option and fill in the blanks with the appropriate numbers and text (such as ",·et al.") if
          you would like the list of authors abbreviated.

   When entering an abbreviation such as ",·et al." You can italicize the abbreviation by selecting the "Italic"
   checkbox in the dialog.

   Remember to save your style after making your changes. See Saving Styles.


Citation Author Lists
   If the style you are using lists the author names in the Citation template of the Style window, you can use the
   Author List options (as well as the Author Names panel) to control how the authors appear in your in-text
   citations. If your citations do not include the author names, ignore the Author List panel.

    Note: In the example text below, small dots (·) are used to indicate where a space should be added in the
    style. These dots will not appear in EndNote's Author Lists panels, spaces will appear instead.


Separators Between Author Names

   In the Author Separators box, enter any punctuation and spaces that separate the individual author names
   in a citation. In references with multiple authors, it is standard to separate the names with a comma and a
   space.

       ▪ Use the between box to enter a comma and a space, or any other required punctuation.

       ▪ In the before last box, enter the separator that appears before the last author in a reference.
          Sometimes this is something other than a comma and a space, such as ",·and·" or an ampersand
          (&) followed by a space.

       ▪ In the before last in format: Author (Year) box, enter the separator that appears before the last author
          in the Author (Year) format. The behavior of this option is the same as the before last box. This
          allows you to meet the specifications of some styles that require different formats depending on
          whether the format used is the default format or the Author (Year) format.

   Normally only the first row in the Author Separators box is used (with the range of authors set at "1 to 100")
   so that the separators in that row apply to all of the authors cited in a reference. However, there are styles in
   which two authors are listed as "Smith and Jones" (without a comma), and more than two are listed as
   "Smith, Jones, and Johnson" (with a comma before the word "and"). In this case, make "·and·" the
   Separator before last author when there are only two authors; and enter ",·and·" when there are 3 or more
   authors.

    Note: Include spaces before and after the word "and" and a space after commas.


Abbreviating the Author List, First Appearance

   Some journals require that you abbreviate the list of authors, using "et al." or an equivalent, after a certain
   number of authors. The Abbreviated Author List section of the Author Lists panel allows you to specify the
   number of authors needed to trigger this abbreviation, how many authors to include in the formatted
   reference, and what the abbreviation should be.

       ▪ List all author names
          Select this option if you do not want to abbreviate the author lists.

       ▪ If ___ or more authors, list the first ___ author(s) and abbreviate with ___
          Select this option and fill in the blanks with the appropriate numbers and text (such as ",·et al.") if
          you would like the list of authors abbreviated.

Abbreviating the Author List, Subsequent Appearances

   In some bibliographic styles, if a reference is cited more than once in your paper the first appearance of it in
   an in-text citation is formatted differently from subsequent citations. For example, the first citation might list
   all authors, while subsequent citations list only the first author followed by "·et al."

   Use the First Appearance author list settings to specify the way the authors appear the first time the
   reference is cited. Use the Subsequent Appearances options to format authors in all other appearances of
   the citation.


Author Names in the Bibliography and Footnotes

Name Format

   There is an Author Names panel for bibliographies and footnotes, as well as for citations. Some styles
   request that author names are formatted differently in all three cases. Be sure that you select the Author
   Names panel from under the appropriate heading. The author names format for citations is described in
   Citation Author Names. This topic describes the options that are available for both the footnote and
   bibliography Author Names panels.

   These settings are for choosing how author names should look— for example, whether the first or last name
   should come first, whether there should be a comma after the last name, and how the names should be
   capitalized.


       Page 486 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       ▪ First Author/Other Authors
          Using the lists for First Author and Other Authors, you can have the first author appear differently
          from the other authors in a reference. From these lists, select the example that shows the name in
          the order that you want in the reference.

       ▪ Capitalization
          Specify how author names should appear.

           ▪ As Is (as entered in the reference)

           ▪ Normal (first letter of each name is capitalized)

           ▪ All Uppercase (all letters are capitalized)

           ▪ Small Caps (the first letter of a name is a large capital and other letters are smaller capitals;
              these may or may not be supported by your word processor)

              If you apply a capitalization option to author names, but have a specific name that you do not
              want changed, you can use the Change Case preference to leave that name as entered. See
              Change Case Preferences.

       ▪ Capitalize only the author's last name
          This option allows you to format only the author's last name in all uppercase. For example, JONES,
          Edward.

       ▪ Initials
          Select from the available options in the list to specify how the initials should appear in the formatted
          references. Click the Initials list to choose how the authors’ first and middle names should be
          formatted. If you have not entered the full first names and you select the Full Names option, EndNote
          uses the names as you have entered them into the reference. Select Last Only to show just the last
          name, with no first or middle initials.

    Note: Initials entered into an EndNote reference must be separated by a period, a space, or a period and
    a space (such as M.J. Stein, M J Stein, or M. J. Stein). Two letters together (such as MJ Stein) will not be
    interpreted as two initials, but instead as a two-letter first name.


Name Format — Short Form (Footnotes only)

   There is an Author Names panel for displaying footnotes in the short form.

       ▪ First Author/Other Authors
          Using the list for First Author and Other Authors, you can have the first author appear differently from
          the other authors in a footnote. From these lists, select the example that shows the name in the
          order that you want in the footnote.

           ▪ Jane Smith

           ▪ Smith, Jane

           ▪ Smith Jane

       Page 487 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      ▪ Capitalization
         Specify how author names should be capitalized. The options are:

          ▪ As Is

          ▪ Normal

          ▪ All Uppercase

          ▪ Small Caps

      ▪ Initials
         Select from the available options in the list to specify how the name or initials should appear in the
         formatted footnote. The options are:

          ▪ Full Name

          ▪ Last Name Only

          ▪ A. B.

          ▪ A.B.

          ▪ AB

          ▪ AB (You cannot enter initials in your library in this format, but EndNote can configure them to
             look this way in the output.)

  When you are finished, remember to save your changes. See Saving Styles.


Citation Author Names

Name Format

  The Name Format section allows you to specify how the author names should look—whether the first or last
  name should come first, and whether there should be a comma after the last name.

  First Author/Other Authors: Using the list for First Author and Other Authors, you can have the first author
  appear differently from the other authors in a reference. From these lists, select the example that shows the
  name in the order that you would like it to be in the citation. If the in-text citations use only the last name,
  this setting is not important.

  Capitalization: Specify how you would like the author names to appear.

  Specify how author names should appear.

      ▪ As Is (as entered in the reference)

      ▪ Normal (first letter of each name is capitalized)

      ▪ All Uppercase (all letters are capitalized)



      Page 488 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       ▪ Small Caps (the first letter of a name is a large capital and other letters are smaller capitals; these
          may or may not be supported by your word processor)

   If you apply a capitalization option to author names, but have a specific name that you do not want changed,
   you can use the Change Case preference to leave that name as entered. See Change Case Preferences.

   Capitalize only the author's last name: This option allows you to format the author's last name in all
   uppercase. For example: JONES, Edward

   Initials: Select from the available options in the list to specify how the initials should look in the citations.
   Select Last Name Only if you only need the last name of the authors to appear in the citations.

   Use initials only for primary authors with the same name: This option allows for initials to be used only
   when there are primary authors with the same last name included in the bibliography. Regardless of whether
   or not the resulting citations are ambiguous (that is, they could be from different years, so not ambiguous),
   EndNote will add the initials to those citations to clarify that they are from different authors who happen to
   have the same surname.

    Note: The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association requires this option for citations
    where different authors have the same last name, even if the citations are from different years. See
    section 6.14 of the APA 6th edition or section 8.20 of the 7th edition of the manual. EndNote APA styles
    are set to follow this requirement.


Consecutive Citations by the Same Author

   If a multiple citation includes works by the same author, some styles request that you not repeat the author
   name. Check the setting to Omit repeated authors and EndNote will omit the author name from the citation
   after it first appears. In order for this setting to be used, the citations must all be grouped together in a
   multiple citation, and the citations by the same author must appear one right after the other.

   For example, a reference such as this:

       (Smith, 1993; Smith, 1999; Wyatt, 2000)

   would be changed to look like this:

       (Smith, 1993, 1999; Wyatt, 2000)

   You may also choose the separator to use between these citations. Notice that in the example above the
   style normally uses a semicolon to separate multiple citations. But when there are a series of citations by
   the same author, the repeated author names are dropped and the years are separated by commas. In this
   case, a comma and a space should be entered as the punctuation with which to separate the consecutive
   citations by the same author.

   If you have entered citations with suffixes and you would like those citations excluded from this formatting,
   check Don’t omit authors from citations that have suffixes. For example, if two references by the same
   author included page numbers:

       (Smith, 1993 p 24; Smith, 1999 p 5; Wyatt, 2000)

   Some styles request that you leave the author name in the second citation for clarity.

Editor List and Editor Names
   To specify how the editors’ names are to be formatted for reference types other than Edited Book, select
   Editor List or Editor Name from under the Bibliography or Footnote heading. In these panels you will find
   some of the same settings that have been described for formatting author names.

   The Editor List settings apply to the generic Secondary Author, Tertiary Author, and Subsidiary Author fields.
   These fields include Editor in the Book Section, Electronic Book Section, Encyclopedia, and Conference
   Proceedings reference types, among others, and Series Editor in the Book and Edited Book reference
   types.

    Note: "Editors" are considered primary authors for the Edited Book reference type. The Author List and
    Author Names settings apply to the primary author field of each reference type. Therefore, Author List and
    Author Names settings apply to the editor’s name in an Edited Book, and the Editor List and Editor
    Names settings apply to the Series Editor’s name in an Edited Book reference type.

   The instructions for the Editor List panel are identical to those described for the corresponding Author List
   panel (see Author Lists in the Bibliography and Footnotes). Similarly, the Name Format options in the Editor
   Name panel are the same as those for Author Name panels (see Author Names in the Bibliography and
   Footnotes).

Name Format — Short Form

   To specify how the editors’ names and the abbreviated editors' list are to be formatted in the footnote short
   form, select Editor Lists or Editor Name from under the Footnote heading. In those panels you will find some
   of the same settings that have been described for formatting author names.

   Use the menus to select how you want to format the following in footnotes:

       ▪ First author

       ▪ Other authors

       ▪ Capitalization

       ▪ Initials
   Remember to save your style after making your changes. See Saving Styles.


Bibliography Layout
   Under the Bibliography heading there is a Layout setting that provides options for inserting text before and
   after each reference in a bibliography, as well as applying hanging indents to your references.

Adding Text Before Each Reference

   In the Start each reference with section, you can specify what information, if any, should appear before each
   reference in your bibliography. (For information on how to add a prefix before a citation, see Citation
   Prefixes).

   A common reference prefix is the bibliography number, which is used by all numbered styles to number the
   references in a bibliography.



       Page 490 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   If you have not yet done so, open the Style window for the style you wish to work with. (See Opening the
   Style Window.)

   To add a bibliography number before each reference:

       1. In the Style window, select Layout from under the Bibliography heading.

       2. Click in the text box below the Start each reference with section, and select Bibliography Number
          from the Insert Field list.

       3. Type the necessary punctuation after the bibliography number (such as a period and a space) or
          insert a tab from the Insert Field list.

   With a style configured in this way, EndNote creates a bibliography with numbered references, such as:

       1. Argus, M.V. New paleontological excavation techniques. Nature 19, 234-237
          (1993).

    Note: To create a hanging indent, where the second and subsequent lines of a reference are indented,
    see Hanging Indents below.


Other Reference Prefix Fields

   Other commonly used reference prefixes appear in the Insert Field list.

       ▪ Reference Type: This option will insert the reference type (such as Journal Article or Book) before
          each reference.

       ▪ Label: Some bibliographic styles use a Label in the citation and the bibliography to refer to each
          entry with a short mnemonic code, often the author’s name and the last two digits of the year. When
          you enter references into your library, you can type the mnemonic code directly into the Label field.
          When EndNote builds a bibliography, it can put that code before each reference.

       ▪ Citation: Selecting Citation as a reference prefix allows you to label the references in the
          bibliography with the in-text citation.

       ▪ Record Number: This option will insert the record number before each reference. The record
          number is the number that EndNote assigns to each reference in the library, and it is also used in the
          unformatted in-text citations. Add Record Number as a reference prefix in any style in order to print
          all the references in your library with their unique EndNote record numbers. Record numbers are not
          unchangeable identifiers and should not be used as permanent identifiers. See Record Numbers.

Adding Text After Each Reference

   Use the End each reference with section of the Layout panel to specify what information, if any, should
   follow each reference in your bibliography. (For information on how to add text after an in-text citation in your
   document, see Citation Suffixes).

   The Insert Field drop-down can be used to add the content of the Label, Keywords, Abstract, or Notes field,
   or the Record Number. Any other text or punctuation can also be entered as a reference suffix and it will
   appear at the end of each reference in the formatted bibliography. Two common uses for the Reference
   Suffix command are shown below.




       Page 491 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


    Note: Although only a limited list of fields is shown on the Insert Field drop-down, any EndNote generic
    field name can be used in the Start each reference with or End each reference with sections. To add
    another field, such as Research Notes or Accession Number, just type the generic field name into the text
    box.


Example: Adding Research Notes to the Bibliography

   If you have research notes that you want to print together with your references, you should add the
   Research Notes field as a reference suffix in the style that you are using to print or format the references.

      1. With the Style window open, select Layout from under the Bibliography heading.

      2. Click in the text box below the End each reference with and type "Research Notes" into the field.
         This will append the Research Notes field to every reference in the bibliography when you format a
         paper with the style. (Research Notes is a field reserved for your personal research notes, and
         EndNote never imports data into it. In comparison, the Notes field may contain data imported from
         online databases. Because "Research Notes" is a generic field name, it can be used to begin or end
         a reference with any reference type.)

   If you want the research notes to begin on a new line after the reference, select End of paragraph from the
   Insert Field list before "Research Notes." If you want the notes to be indented, select Tab from the Insert
   Field list before the words "Research Notes."

Adding or Removing Blank Lines Between References

   Another common use for the Layout options is to add a blank line between references. To do this, edit the
   style as described above, and insert a paragraph mark, using End of paragraph on the Insert Field list, into
   the End each reference with section.

   To tighten up the bibliography and get rid of the blank line after each reference, edit the style, click on the
   Layout panel, and select and delete the paragraph mark to get rid of the blank line.

Hanging Indents

   Many numbered bibliographic styles require a hanging indent, as shown in this example:

       1. Vonk J, Shackelford TK, editors. The Oxford handbook of comparative
          evolutionary psychology. New York: Oxford University Press; 2012.

       2. Zorina ZA, Obozova TA. New Data on the Brain and Cognitive Abilities
          of Birds. Zoologichesky Zhurnal. 2011;90(7):784-802.

       3. Smirnova AA. On the capability of birds for symbolization. Biology
          Bulletin. 2011;38(9):878-84.

   EndNote provides a few hanging indent options. Normally, each reference is one paragraph, so some of
   these options would not apply. But if you have a reference that includes more than one paragraph, EndNote
   gives you options for which paragraph within a reference the hanging indents should apply. Examples of
   multi-paragraph references include annotated bibliographies where the research notes follow each
   reference, or a style such as those common in anthropology journals where the authors are on a line of their
   own.

   Hanging indent options include: None, All Paragraphs, First Paragraph Only, Second Paragraph Only, and
   All Paragraphs but the First. The following is an example of when you would use Second Paragraph Only.
   The style requires that authors begin on the left margin, and then the year (and the rest of the reference)


       Page 492 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   starts on a new line and is indented. The style applies a hanging indent to the second paragraph only, and
   inserts a tab before and after the year. In the word processing document, the spacing for the hanging indent
   should be aligned with the second tab stop.

   Smirnova, A. A.
       2011 On the capability of birds for symbolization. Biology Bulletin
             38(9):878-884.
   Vonk, Jennifer, and Todd K. Shackelford, eds.

       2011 New Data on the Brain and Cognitive Abilities of Birds. Zoologi-
             chesky Zhurnal 90(7):784-802.

   The spacing used for tabs and indents is determined by the ruler settings in your word processor.

    Note: If you are creating a numbered bibliography, as shown in the previous example, insert a tab after
    the bibliography number to have the references line up correctly.


Tabs

   Tabs may be inserted from the Insert Field list. A tab entered into a style will appear as a tab in the formatted
   bibliography. The tab appears as an arrow on the screen. The width of the tab as it appears in the
   bibliography is determined by the tab settings in your word processor.

   Tabs are often entered after the bibliography number as part of the Layout settings. This helps to align the
   start of each reference after the number, which is especially important if the bibliography entries use a
   hanging indent.


Sort Order: Bibliographies and Multiple Citations
   Each style has instructions for sorting references in the bibliography, and how to sort formatted multiple
   citations in the text of your paper. Select Sort Order from under either the Citations or Bibliography
   headings.

Multiple Citation Sort

   The Sort panel under the Citation heading allows you to set the order that the style uses to sort multiple in-
   text citations. For example, an unformatted multiple citation looks like this:

       {Lee, 2015 #5; Jacob, 2020 #22; Zoler, 2011 #19}

   Formatted with the Author-Date style, the citations are sorted chronologically and the formatted citation
   looks like this:

       (Zoler 2011; Lee 2015; Jacob 2020)

   Options for sorting multiple citations include:

       ▪ Same as Bibliography: Sorts multiple citations in the same order as the Bibliography Sort Order.

       ▪ Author + Title: Sorts multiple citations first by authors and then by title.

       ▪ Author + Year + Title: Sorts multiple citations first by authors, then by year, and then by title.

       Page 493 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       ▪ Year + Author: Sorts multiple citations chronologically. Then citations from the same year are sorted
          based on author names.

       ▪ Don’t Sort: Multiple citations remain in the same order as they appear in the unformatted temporary
          citations.

       ▪ Other: A custom sort order is applied to multiple citations. See Custom Sorting.

Bibliography Sort Order

   The Bibliography Sort Order section determines how the bibliography should be sorted. Common options
   are listed, and you may also configure a custom sort order.

       ▪ Order of Appearance: References are listed in the order in which they are cited in the paper.

       ▪ Author + Title: References are sorted by the Author field. References with identical authors are
          sorted by title.

       ▪ Author + Year + Title: References are sorted by the Author field, then references with identical
          authors are sorted by year. References with identical authors and years are then sorted by title.

       ▪ First Author + Year + Other Authors: References are sorted by just the first author, then references
          with identical primary authors are sorted by year. References with identical primary authors and
          years are then sorted based on the other authors in the reference.

       ▪ First Author + # of Authors + Year: References are sorted by just the first author, then by the
          number of authors in the reference. For references with the same primary author and the same
          number of authors, they are then sorted chronologically based on the Year field.

       ▪ Other: A custom sort order is applied to the references in the bibliography. See Custom Sorting.

       ▪ Sort Edited Works After Original Works By Same Author: Some styles request that if the same
          person is the author for a book and the editor for an edited book, the original works by that author
          are sorted first, and then the edited works follow. This is an exception to the sorting rules that can be
          applied to the other sort options provided.

    Note: When sorting by Author field, EndNote sorts based on all information in the Author field, including
    all author names (not just the first author) and initials. To see about omitting parts of author names or the
    initial words of a title when sorting, see Sorting Preferences.


Custom Sorting

   To sort references or multiple citations differently from the options in the Citation Sort Order or Bibliography
   Sort Order sections, select the option for Other, and then select from the drop-down field lists any
   combination of up to five fields, in ascending or descending order.

   This dialog is identical to the one that appears when you select Sort Library from the Library menu. You do
   not need to use all five options. The button at the right of each box controls the direction of the sort, either
   ascending or descending order. Clicking these buttons toggles the sort order between ascending and
   descending order.

   At the bottom of the dialog is a drop-down menu of languages. The default will be the language used by
   your operating system, but you can change the language rules used for sorting here.



       Page 494 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   Once you have set up your sorting strategy, click OK to return to the main Sort Order panel for the style. The
   Other section will now display your custom sorting instructions.


Reference Type Categories in Output Styles
   This feature allows you to add subject categories to your Microsoft Word documents that are associated with
   specific reference types. When EndNote creates the bibliography in Word, it organizes your citations based
   on how you have set up the categories in the output style.

Creating a Reference Type Category Style Template

      1. From the Tools menu, select Output Styles, and then select the Open Style Manager command.

      2. Select a style.

      3. Select the Categories option from under the Bibliography section to open a blank style template.

      4. Add categories (subheadings) to the text box in the template. Enter a unique name to identify each
         category.

          You can align your categories to the left or center the text. You can also use various styles such as
          bold, italics, and underline to make your categories stand out.

      5. Under each category, insert one or more reference types. You can insert as many reference types as
         you like. However, insert any specific reference type only once.

      6. Continue to create categories and insert reference types until you have included all the reference
         types you think will be used in your papers.

      7. From the style's File menu, select the Save as command.

      8. Give the style a name and save the style.

Select Your Output Style in Microsoft Word

      1. Open your Microsoft Word document.

      2. Select the EndNote 2025 tab.

      3. Select the output style that contains the text categories and reference types defined in your new
         style.

      4. Insert the needed citations in your Word document.

      5. When you are finished writing your paper, go to the end of the document to review the bibliography.

   EndNote creates a bibliography and inserts the selected references under the appropriate categories based
   on the reference type. At this point, you can modify and edit the bibliography (see Configure Categories
   Dialog in Microsoft Word). For example, you can:

       ▪ Rename a category.

       ▪ Delete a category.


       Page 495 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       ▪ Move references (using drag and drop) from one category to another.

Important Points About Categories and Reference Types

       ▪ Insert one or more reference types under each bibliography category.

       ▪ Enter a unique name to identify each category that you create.

       ▪ Organize categories in the template based on how you want the categories to appear in the
          bibliography.

       ▪ Insert only one reference type per line.

       ▪ Insert a reference type only once per output style. For example, do not insert the Journal reference
          type under several categories.

       ▪ Apply text styles only to categories—not to reference types. EndNote treats a reference type as plain
          text (not as a reference) in the bibliography if you apply any text style to it.

       ▪ If you have not included a reference type in the Categories section, EndNote will place undefined
          reference types into a generic Uncategorized References category.


Field Substitutions in Bibliographies and Footnotes

If Fields Are Empty

   The Field Substitutions panels under the Bibliography and Footnotes headings allow you to substitute
   another field in the bibliography or footnotes of a reference if one of the following fields is empty. A set of
   common substitution options are shown as defaults, but you can change the substitution field, and the
   formatting for it, if you wish.

       ▪ DOI

       ▪ PMCID

       ▪ Volume and Pages (Both fields must be empty.)
   You can choose to activate field substitutions by selecting the checkbox by the field that might be empty. For
   example, if you select the If the DOI field is empty, use checkbox, by default the URL field will be used
   instead, EndNote uses the URL if the DOI field is empty in the bibliography and footnotes of a reference. If
   the DOI field is not empty, EndNote displays the DOI information.

   You can also select another field from the Insert Field list if you do not want to use the default value.

   To substitute field values in a bibliography and/or footnote:

      1. In the Style window, select Field Substitutions from under the Bibliography or Footnotes heading.

      2. Activate field substitution by selecting the checkbox of each field.

      3. Accept the default, or delete it from the text box and replace it with a field on the Insert Field list.

      4. Add any formatting or punctuation that is needed for the new field.

      5. Save your changes to the style. If unsure how to save changes, see Saving Styles.

       Page 496 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


    Note: Even if you are using the default substitution, check the punctuation provided for it against the
    style's requirements. You may need to change the punctuation to match your journal's or style manual's
    requirements.


Examples of When to Use This Feature

       ▪ You are citing a prepress article that has a DOI number but not volume or page information.
          Some guidelines indicate that the DOI should be included in a reference for the prepress articles.

       ▪ You are citing a PubMed article; it has been assigned an NIHMSID, but it has not yet been assigned
          a PMCID. Style guidelines may indicate that the NIHMSID should be used as a substitution.

          What is the difference between a PMCID and an NIHMSID? The PMCID is the unique permanent
          identifier assigned when an article is approved for publication at PubMed Central (PMC). The
          NIHMSID is a temporary identifier assigned when an article is submitted for publication at PubMed
          Central. The NIHMSID is only to be used for the first 90 days after it is assigned or until an article
          has been granted a PMCID. You can find more information on this at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
          pmc/about/public-access-info/.

If Editor and Translator Fields Are the Same

   Some style guidelines request if the editor and translator of a reference is the same person, you should
   enter only the Editor field with preceeding text indicating the same person did both. The default is "edited
   and translated by Editor."



Repeated Citations in Footnotes
   Most of the complex formatting in footnotes is relevant only to styles in the humanities. There are a wide
   variety of formats required for citing references that are repeated in the footnotes of a paper. Citations that
   are not repeated in consecutive footnotes are covered by the short form set in the footnote template. See
   Bibliography and Footnote Templates and Rules for Working with Style Templates for information on setting
   up templates, including the short form template.

   Some styles take the shortening of references in footnotes even farther when the repeated references
   appear in consecutive footnotes (or in the same footnote). EndNote provides additional options for the
   special handling of these cases in the Repeated Citations panel.

If the Same Reference Repeats in Consecutive Citations

   When the same reference repeats in consecutive footnotes, you have three general options for how the
   repeated citation will be handled.

       ▪ Replace repeated data with: This option will allow you to replace the repeated data with text and/or
          a field of your choice. This is normally "Ibid." (or a variation of the term). You may also select an
          option from the Insert Field list. For example, the Cited Pages option lists the page numbers when
          the same reference repeats in consecutive footnotes. In this instance, you would have to go to the
          Edit & Manage Citations dialog in Cite While You Write, or use the "@" sign and the page numbers to
          enter a temporary marker if using Format Paper, so the cited pages would show in the document.
          See Editing Citations in Microsoft Word, Editing Citations in OpenOffice Writer, and Citation Suffixes
          for information on editing citations to include cited pages.

       ▪ Omit repeated data: This option allows you to omit the repeated data and replace it with nothing.


       Page 497 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       ▪ Use short form: This option will use the Short Form template defined in the Footnote Templates
           panel.

    Note: The option to include the Volume field only applies to the Book and Book Section reference types. It
    does not apply to all reference types.


If the Same Source Repeats in Consecutive Citations

   This setting does not apply to the identical reference that repeats in consecutive footnotes, but rather if any
   of the source data repeats in two consecutive citations in multiple citation format. For example, if two
   different references happen to be from the same journal, these settings would apply to the journal name,
   volume, and issue (or whatever portion of that source information is identical).

       ▪ Replace repeated data with: This option will replace the repeated data with "Ibid" (or text of your
           choice). If you choose this option, you may also limit the replacement to only the Secondary Title
           field (this includes the journal, magazine, or newspaper name, or the title of a book for a book
           section).

       ▪ No special handling: This option will use the Short Form template defined in the Footnote
           Templates panel.

    Note: We realize that many of these detailed settings for the style can be confusing. We have done our
    best to configure the styles for you so that you will not need to edit them and work through these details
    on your own. However, if you find that you need to modify these parts of your styles, consult your style
    guide for more detailed descriptions and examples of handling repeated citations in footnotes.


Title Capitalization in Output Styles
   Both the Footnotes and Bibliography sections have a Title Capitalization panel. This lets you enter one style
   of capitalization for the titles in your bibliographic references, and another format for when the references
   appear in footnotes.

   Options for title capitalization include:

       ▪ Leave titles as entered: No changes are made.

       ▪ Headline style capitalization: The first letter of every significant word is capitalized, following the
           American English rules for capitalization, wherein articles, conjunctions, and prepositions are not
           capitalized. If you are working with a language other than English, you may wish to choose Leave
           titles as entered and edit the references to match the capitalization requirements of that language.

       ▪ Sentence style capitalization: Only the first letter of every title is capitalized.

    Note: See Change Case Preferences eo enter words or acronyms that should not be adjusted when
    EndNote changes the capitalization of titles.



Figure and Table Placement and Captions
   The Figures and Tables settings apply to images inserted into a Word document from EndNote. You can
   place images where they are cited in a document or at the end of the document, and you have control over
   the placement and punctuation of labels and captions.


       Page 498 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   While style guidelines tend to be very specific in regard to formatted citations and bibliographies, they are
   often vague about figure and table placement. They may require different placement for different document
   types (theses, term papers, journal articles, and so on), or they may not offer instructions at all.

   If an EndNote style's figure and table placement options do not meet your needs, you can change them.
   Please check your own style documentation (or check with your editor or teacher) for specific guidelines
   about image placement for the type of document you are creating.

    Note: Additional Figures and Tables settings are available in the Cite While You Write Preferences, and
    can override output style settings. See Figures and Tables Preferences in Word.


Figures and Tables
   Under the Figures and Tables heading in the left column of the output style editor, select either Figures or
   Tables. Tables are images inserted from the Figure field in the "Chart or Table" reference type. Figures are
   images inserted from the Figure field of any other EndNote reference type. The same options are available
   under each, which allows you to place figures differently than tables.

Placement

   Under Placement, select a button to either place the images within the text of the document, near the
   reference to the figure, or to place images in a list at the end of the document.

   If your images are placed in-text, you can use Cite While You Write preferences to override this automatic
   placement when your document is reformatted. This is helpful if you have moved your images around in the
   document and want to retain their placement. See Figures and Tables Preferences in Word.

Caption

   Next, under Caption, select a button to place the label and caption either above or below the image. You can
   also select the checkbox to place the label and caption on separate lines.

    Note: The label inserted by EndNote is "Figure #" for images found in the Figure and Equation reference
    types as well as for most other reference types. The label is "Table #" for images found in the "Chart or
    Table" reference type. The Caption is the text typed into the Caption field of a reference.


Separation and Punctuation for Figures and Tables
   Under Image Separation, you can enter separators for images inserted within the text of a document and for
   images that are listed at the end of a document.

    Note: The settings on this panel affect both figures and tables.


Image Separation

   When images are inserted in-text, you can specify the number of lines to insert before and after the image to
   separate it from text. This setting affects both figures and tables that are placed in-text. If your images are
   placed in a list at the end of the document, this setting is ignored.




       Page 499 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   When images are placed in a list at the end of the document, you can separate each figure or table with a
   page break or a specified number of blank lines before and after each image. If your images are placed in-
   text, this setting is ignored.

Caption Punctuation

   For each figure or table inserted into Word from an EndNote reference, EndNote generates a label and then
   inserts the caption from the Caption field of the EndNote reference. For example:

       Table 1. Avian Developmental Stages

   You can select the checkboxes to insert a period after the label and/or after the caption. This affects the
   labels and captions for both figures and tables.

   EndNote will attempt to remove double punctuation in case you inadvertently include a period within the
   record as well as selecting one here.


Creating a New Style
   It is often easier to modify an existing bibliographic style that closely resembles a style you need than it is to
   create a new style from scratch. (See Modifying Style Templates). If you do wish to create a new
   style, Creating an Author Date Style gives you a general overview of the process.

   Creating a bibliographic style involves building templates for the in-text citations and the bibliographic
   references to mimic how you want them to appear in your paper. Then adjust the various options to be sure
   that authors, titles, pages, and other fields are being formatted according to your requirements. Creating an
   Author Date Style guides you through the creation of a fictitious author-date type of style.


Creating an Author Date Style
   A new style need only contain a Citation template and a Generic Bibliography template for it to produce
   citations and bibliographies for any paper. The Citation template applies to all in-text citations, and the
   Generic bibliography template applies to all reference types that do not have templates of their own in the
   style. The Generic template should be considered a default template, and you should add additional
   templates for the standard reference types which you use. If you define a specific template for any reference
   types, they are formatted according to that template, and not the Generic format.

    Note: For the example text in templates shown below, a small dot (·) is used to indicate a standard space.
    This is just to clarify spacing in the style. The dots will only show in the style when working in the
    templates; they do not show in other style panels.


Create a New Style

      1. To create a bibliographic style, go to the Tools menu, select Output Style, and then select New Style,
         and a new Untitled Style window appears.

Create the (Author, Year) Citation Template

      1. Select the Templates panel under the Citations heading.

      2. Place the cursor in the text box under the Citation heading in the Citations Templates panel.



       Page 500 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      3. Type an open parenthesis.

      4. Click the Insert Field button and select Author from the list of available fields.

      5. Type a comma and a space.

      6. Select Year from the Insert Field list.

      7. Type the closing parenthesis.

Create the Author (Year) Citation Template

      1. Select the Templates panel under the Citations heading.

      2. Place the cursor in the text              box   under   the   Citation    — Author      (Year)    heading   in
         the Citations Templates panel.

      3. Click the Insert Field button and select Author from the list of available fields, then type a space.

      4. Type an open parenthesis.

      5. Select Year from the Insert Field list.

      6. Type the closing parenthesis.

Set the Number of Authors in the Citation

      1. Select Author Lists under the Citations heading.

      2. The default setting for Abbreviated Author List — First Appearance is to list all author names in the
         citation. For this example, let's change this setting to show up to three author names the first time a
         reference is cited, and two authors and "et al." in italics if there are more than three authors.

          a. Click the radio button under Abbreviated Author List — First Appearance that starts with If 3 or
             more authors... (3 is only the default).

          b. Change the 3 to a 4 where it says If 3 or more authors, then change 1 to 2 where it says list the
             first 1 author(s), then mark the Italic checkbox. It should now show something like this:

                 If 4 or more authors, list the first 2 author(s) and abbreviate with , et al.    Italic

              With this setting, if there are up to three authors, all authors will appear in the citation. If there
              are more than three authors (4 or more authors), only two authors will appear, followed by
              ", et al."

      3. The default setting for Abbreviated Author List — Subsequent Appearances is also to list all authors.
         Let's change this to show only the first author and when repeated citations have more three authors.

          a. Click the radio button under Abbreviated Author List — Subsequent Appearances for the option
             that begins with If 3 or more authors…

          b. Change the 3 to 4 where it says If 3 or more authors, then leave the option set to 1 where it says
             list the first 1 author(s), and finally, mark the Italic box. (If you wanted it to show something other
             than ", et al." you could change the text.) It should now show something like this:



      Page 501 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


                 If 4 or more authors, list the first 1 author(s) and abbreviate with , et al.   Italic

              With this setting, if there are up to three authors, all authors will appear in the repeated citation.
              If there are more than three authors (4 or more authors), only the first author will appear,
              followed by ", et al."

Set the Author Names to Show Only the Last Name in the Citation

      1. Select Author Name under the Citations heading.

      2. For the citations, we want only the author's last names to show, with no special capitalization
         options, so we will leave most of these settings as shown in the defaults. However, we would like the
         author name to be shown only once if an author has two references in the same grouped citation.
         For example, instead of (Smith, 2012; Smith, 2020), we want it to show (Smith, 2012, 2020). Set this
         by marking the checkbox Omit repeated authors under Consecutive Citation by the Same Author. To
         use a comma instead of a semicolon between the years, mark the box Separate these citations
         with and leave the default option to use a comma and a space as it is.

Create a Generic Bibliography Template

   Next, define the Generic format which serves as the default template for reference types that do not have
   their own template.

   Our style uses the author name and the year in the citation. They are surrounded by parentheses and
   separated by a comma. Most styles that show the author and year in citations also begin with those fields
   and sort the bibliography by the author name, then by the year, then by the title, so we will create
   bibliography settings to do so.

      1. Select Templates under the Bibliography heading, then click on Generic. Your cursor should now be
         located in the Generic text box, where you can enter the fields and punctuation for your style.

      2. Select Author from the Insert Field list to add the Author field to the style template. (You can also
         type "Author" but it is safer to select the field name from the list, to avoid typos.) Type a period and a
         space. Continue adding fields and punctuation until you have a line that looks like the one below.

          Author.·(Year).·Title.·Place·Published,·Publisher.

      3. In this style, the title must be italicized, so double-click the word Title to select it and apply
         italic formatting. Choose the formatting option from the toolbar in the Style window, or select the
         option from the Font submenu in the style's Edit menu. See Fonts and Text in Output Styles or more
         information on working with fonts in EndNote. You can also use the following shortcuts to apply text
         formatting.

          a. Ctrl+B for bold

          b. Ctrl+I for italic

          c. Ctrl+U for underline

          d. Ctrl+Shift++ (the last + is the plus sign, so this means to hold down the Ctrl key, the Shift key,
             and the + key together) for superscript

          e. Ctrl+Shift+‒ (the ‒ is the minus sign, so this means to hold down the Ctrl key, the Shift key, and
             the ‒ key together) for subscript



       Page 502 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      4. Save the new style by selecting Save As from the style's File menu. In the dialog that appears, type
         "Practice Style" as the name of this style and click Save. This will save the style and add it as an
         option in the Output Styles submenu of the Tools menu.

Test the Style

   Open your library,select a reference, and expand the Preview subpanel on the Reference > Summary panel.
   Select different references in your library to see how they format. You will probably see that the books look
   good, but journal articles do not display enough information. You will need to return to the style and create a
   template to format journal articles.

Create a New Template for Journals

   In the Templates panel under the Bibliography heading, select Journal Article from the Reference Type drop-
   down list. This will create a new section for a Journal Article template. Insert the fields and punctuation to
   create a template as shown below:

       Author·(Year). Title. Journal. Volume (Issue) Pages.

   Save the style by selecting Save from the style's File menu. Return to the Library window, and check the
   preview to see how journal article references are formatted.

Setting a Sort Order

   Our practice style's bibliography and citations need to be sorted by Authors, Year, and then by the Title. To
   do this:

      1. Select Sort Order under the Bibliography heading to set the sorting options for the bibliography.

      2. Select the third option, Author + Year + Title.

      3. Select Sort Order under the Citations heading to set the sorting option for the Citations.

      4. Select the first option, Same as bibliography. This will sort citations within a grouped citation in the
         same order they would be sorted in the bibliography.

   To explore more options for sorting citations in a style, see Sort Order: Bibliographies and Multiple Citations.

Finishing the Style

   Continue testing how other reference types format, and include additional reference type templates as
   necessary. See Modifying Style Templates for specifics about creating and modifying style templates. See
   Special Formatting Characters for information on how to use special characters to provide more control over
   formatting in templates.

   Look at how the author names are formatted, and change the necessary settings. You should also take a
   close look at pages, title capitalization, the sort order of the references, and various other options provided
   in the Style window. These are described in the section on Additional Style Formatting Options.

Import Filters
Introduction to Filters
   The Import command on the File menu provides a way to import text files of reference data into EndNote
   libraries, or EndNote XML files exported from EndNote. EndNote has a number of built-in import options as
   well as a large collection of configurable import filters. Filters are designed to import references downloaded
   from specific online bibliographic databases, or to import data exported from other bibliographic software
   programs.

   You can edit and create import filters. The process of importing references using the Import command is
   described in Importing Reference Data into EndNote.

   EndNote provides hundreds of import filters for a variety of sources. By default, only the most popular filters
   are stored as individual files in the Filters folder in your EndNote program folder. To install additional filters,
   see Installing Additional Filters.


What is a Filter?
   Import filters provide a wide range of import options. A filter is selected during the import process to show
   EndNote exactly how to interpret the information in your data file (the records downloaded or saved from an
   online database or exported from another program). A filter does this by mapping the information in each
   downloaded reference to the corresponding fields in EndNote.

   Because each database offered by the various information providers has its own way to organize reference
   data, there needs to be a different filter for each database. Each filter provided with EndNote has been
   configured to import data files from a specific database offered by a single information provider. You can
   easily modify any of the supplied filters or create a new filter to import from other databases.


A Comment About Difficult Data Files
   Although EndNote’s filters are very powerful and flexible import tools, there are still some data files that
   cannot be conquered. Whereas some databases provide very clean tagged data, others are almost
   impossible to discern. Lack of consistency in the source data and the omission of reference type tags often
   make it difficult for a person to understand the information: the task of creating a perfect filter to handle
   these files is futile. When fine tuning our filters, we have done our best to capture the necessary data—even
   if that means dropping it all into the Notes field. If you find filters that can be further improved, please let us
   know. It may also help to contact your information provider to let them know that the inconsistencies in the
   data entry for the database are keeping you from most efficiently making use of it.


Installing Additional Filters
   See Installing Additional Filters for instructions on installing additional filters.


The Filter Manager
   EndNote provides hundreds of import filters for a variety of sources. By default, only the most popular filters
   are stored as individual files in the Filters folder in your EndNote program folder. To install additional filters,
   see Installing Additional Filters.

       Page 505 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   To access the Filter Manager, select Import Filters > Open Filter Manager… from the Tools menu.

   The Filter Manager lists the names of the original filter files available in the C:\Program Files (x86)\EndNote
   2025\Filters folder, as well as any new or modified filters in your personal Filters folder, and gives you the
   option to edit them or select them as "favorites" for quick access when you use the Import command. You
   can click and drag the corner of the dialog to increase the size.

   Use these features to locate the import filter you want to use:

       ▪ If you know the name of the filter that you want to use, you may start typing it and the first filter name
           that matches what you type will be selected.

       ▪ Click the Find By button and select an information provider’s name (such as OCLC) to find only the
           import filters for a specific information provider.

       ▪ Click the Find By button and select All Filters to return all of the import filters to the displayed list.

       ▪ Click a column heading to sort the import filters by name or by information provider. Clicking the
           same column heading a second time will change the sort order from ascending to descending order.
           Click again to set it back to ascending order.

       ▪ Click the More Info button at the bottom of the dialog to display additional information about the
           selected filter.

       ▪ Click the Get More on the Web button to open your browser and navigate to the EndNote download
           site to access more filters.


Marking Your Favorite Import Filters
   When you have found a filter that you will want to use in the future, mark the checkbox to the left of it in the
   Favorites column to add it as a favorite. All filters that are marked as favorites appear in the Import Options
   list in the Import dialog. You can get to the Import dialog by selecting Import from the File menu. This gives
   you easy access to those files you use most often.

   To mark all of the filters for a specific information provider, click the Find By button and, from that list, select
   the name of the information provider. Then, with just that subset of filters listed in the Filter Manager window,
   click Mark All. The Unmark All option may be used to unmark all of the filters that are showing in the list.

  EndNote filters use the file name extension of ".enf" (for EndNote Filter), as in "PubMed (NLM).enf."


Copying Filters
  When you display a list of filters in EndNote, the list is comprised of the installed filters found in the \
  \Program Files (x86)\EndNote 2025\Filters folder, as well as new or modified filters found in your personal
  Filters folder. For an explanation of where your files are stored, see Folder Locations Preferences.

  There are two ways to copy filters. Since each filter is a separate file on your hard drive, you can copy them
  as you would copy any file on your hard drive using the File Explorer.

  To make a copy of a filter from within EndNote:

     1. From the Tools menu, select Import Filters and select Open Filter Manager.

     2. Select the filter you want to copy and click Edit.

     3. Without making any changes to the filter, select Save As from the filter's File menu.

     4. Give this copy of the filter a new name, and then save it.

  The file is saved in your personal Filters folder. The new filter will remain open. The original filter will be left
  untouched.


Deleting Filters
  To delete a filter from within EndNote:

     1. From the Tools menu, select Import Filters > Open Filter Manager.

     2. Right-click on the filter to be deleted and select Delete Filter… from the menu, or press the Delete
        key.

     3. You will be asked for a confirmation of if you really want to delete the filter. Select Yes to delete the
        filter or No to keep it.

  You can also delete an unwanted filter by opening File Explorer and opening the appropriate Filters folder
  (see Folder Locations Preferences). Then, drag the filter from the Filter folder to the Recycle Bin, or select
  the file and press the Delete key.

   Note: You must have read/write access to the Filters folder in order to delete a filter. If you do not have
   administrator access, you likely will not be able to delete a file located within the Program Files (x86)
   folder.

The Basic Components of a Filter
   You need to know the basic components of a filter if you want to customize or create a filter.

       ▪ To create a new import filter: From the Tools menu, select Import Filters, and then select New Filter.
           If you are interested in creating a new filter, also read Creating a New Filter.

       ▪ To edit a filter: From the Tools menu, select Import Filters, and then select Open Filter Manager.
           Select the filter to edit and click Edit. The most recently used filter can also be easily edited by
           selecting Import Filters from the Tools menu, and selecting Edit [Filter Name].

   These topics explain the basic components of a filter:

       ▪ The Filter Editor Window

       ▪ About this Filter

       ▪ Working with Filter Templates

       ▪ The Filter Options

The Filter Editor Window
   After choosing the option to edit an existing filter or create a new one, EndNote opens the Filter Editor
   window.

   All of the different options for editing a filter are listed on the left side of the Filter Editor. Click on an item to
   view the associated settings. You may switch between panels as needed while editing the file. No changes
   are saved in any of the panels until you select Save As from the filter's File menu.

   If at any time you need to revert your changes back to the last saved copy of the filter, select Revert Filter
   from the filter's File menu.

   To close a Filter window, click the Close button in the upper right corner of the window, or select Close Filter
   from the filter's File menu. If you have not saved your changes to the filter, EndNote prompts you and gives
   you the option to save or discard any changes that you have made.


About this Filter
   The Filter Editor opens to display the About This Filter panel. This panel contains descriptive information
   about the filter. None of the information used in this panel has any impact on how well the filter works, it is
   just descriptive.

   File Name: Displays the name of the filter as it appears in the Filters folder in the EndNote folder. The file
   name extension (.enf) is not displayed. The name of the filter cannot be changed here; you would need to
   close this window and switch back to the File Explorer to rename the filter.

   Full Name: This name will not be displayed in the Filter Manager, but this field allows you to assign a longer,
   more descriptive name, if you choose.

   Based On: Enter any information about what documentation was used to create the filter. Commonly the
   server documentation is available on the Web, so you could enter a URL here as well to make it easy to
   later retrieve that information.

   Information Provider: The category is typically the information provider (such as OCLC), but you may enter
   anything that will help you categorize and organize your filters. The category information is also shown in
   the Filter Manager window, in the column next to the name of the filter. In that window, you may sort filters
   by category and also search for them by category.

   Created: The date the filter was installed or created.

   Last Modified: The date the filter was last modified.

   Comments and Limitations: Enter any helpful information such as how to download references in the
   format that works with this filter.

   All of the information except the Full Name in this panel is visible in the Filter Manager if you click the More
   Info option at the bottom of the Filter Manager window. (The Information Provider appears as "Category" in
   the More Info view.) This is helpful because you do not need to edit a filter to view the comments or other
   descriptive information. You may scroll through the available filters in the Filter Manager window and view
   the information there.


Working with Filter Templates
Filter Templates in Import Filters and Connection Files
   The most important part of a filter or connection file is the Templates section. The templates define how the
   various lines of tagged data in your data file should be imported and filtered into the different EndNote fields
   (such as Author, Year, and Title). Different sets of templates are required for the different reference types
   that may be in your data file.

   The Templates panel consists of individual Reference Type templates which correspond to the way the
   reference data is presented in the data file. These topics will help you:

Navigating in the Templates Panel in Import Filters and Connection Files
   The Templates panel in a filter is divided into a Tag column and a Field(s) column. The tag and its
   corresponding field(s) are two separate cells in a row. If a cell is active, an outline appears around the cell.

        Tag                      Field(s)

        TI:                      Title

   To move from one cell to the next, press the Tab key or click the mouse in the desired cell. To move back to
   the previous cell, hold down the Shift key while pressing the Tab key.

   To change the width of the Tag column in the Filter window, position the cursor over the vertical line dividing
   the Tag and Field(s) columns. The cursor changes to indicate that you are in the correct place. Click and
   drag to the right or left to resize the column widths.

   Click the Reference Types list to change the view to a different reference type (such as from Journal Article
   to Book).


Tags and Fields in Import Filters and Connection Files
   There are two columns shown in the template of an import filter: Tag and Field(s). The Tag precedes the
   data that will be imported into EndNote; the Tag itself is not imported. There must be at least one space
   between the Tag and the data for EndNote to import the data.

   Importing works by pattern matching. The pattern of the tag and the pattern of the field data in the text file
   must match the pattern in the Tag column and the contents of the Field(s) column of the filter.

        Tag             Field(s)

        TI:             Title


        Tag             Field(s)

              TI:       Title

   Notice the difference in the Tag columns of the examples above. In the first example, there are no spaces
   before the tag. This would work when importing if the original data file had the tag at the left margin, with no
   preceding spaces. However, if the original data file had three spaces between each tag and the left margin,
   You would need to build your filter as shown in the second example, with three spaces before the tag in the
   Tag column.

   When setting up the Tag for filters, include any spaces that precede the tag in the original data file.

   Along with the spacing needing to be the same, the tag must be capitalized the same way in the filter as it is
   in the data.


Templates for Different Reference Types in Import Filters and Connection
Files
   The Templates panel includes templates for all of the various reference types (Journal Article or Book, for
   example).


       Page 510 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   Click the Reference Types list to change the view to a different reference type (such as from Journal Article
   to Book).

   The reference types that have a check mark displayed next to them already have a template defined (you
   can edit the template if you wish). The reference type that appears in bold type is currently the default
   reference type.

   The only reference types templates that need to be filled in are the ones that correspond to the reference
   types in your data file. For example, if the database from which you are downloading contains only journal
   articles, you would only need to fill in the templates for the Journal Article section in that particular filter.

   Importing works through pattern matching. The pattern of the template must match the pattern of the data
   being imported. Within each reference type template there is a list of tags and their corresponding EndNote
   field names. These templates should exactly match the way the information is organized in the data file. Any
   text, leading spaces (including spaces from the left margin to the beginning of a tag), or punctuation that you
   see that is not part of a field name (such as "vol." before the Volume) is included to make the template
   exactly match the data file.


Adding and Deleting Rows in the Filter Template in Import Filters and
Connection Files
   When adding and deleting rows, the order of the tags does not have to match the order of the tags in the
   data file. There is one case in which the order of the tags is important: if you are entering multiple variations
   of one tagged line, you should enter the repeated lines for that tag in order from the most complex to the
   simplest. This is because EndNote looks for matches starting from the top of the window working down the
   list of tags. It stops at the first template that matches the tagged data.

   To start a new row immediately below the active row, position the cursor in the Field(s) cell, and press Enter.

   To start a new row immediately above the active row, position the cursor in the Tag cell, and press Enter.

   To delete a row, select the row and then select Cut from the filter's Edit menu.


Cutting, Copying and Pasting Rows in Import Filters and Connection Files
   You may use the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands to move or duplicate a cell or a row of cells. To do so:

      1. Select a row by dragging the mouse across both columns. (Dragging the mouse vertically across
         more than one row selects a range of rows.)

      2. To duplicate the selected row(s) elsewhere in a filter, select Copy (Ctrl+C) from the filter's Edit menu.
         If you want to delete the selected row and move it to another location, select Cut (Ctrl+X).

      3. Click where you would like the cut or copied row to appear, and select Paste (Ctrl+V) from the filter's
         Edit menu. If the cursor is in the Tag colomn, the pasted row will be inserted above the row where
         the cursor is; if the cursor is in the Field(s) column, the pasted row will be inserted below. (Pasting
         when an entire row is selected will replace the row.)

Copying and Pasting Between Reference Type Templates

   By choosing Select All (Ctrl+A) from the Edit menu, you can select all of the rows in a given Reference Type
   template. This is useful for copying an entire template to a new reference type or filter. After copying the




       Page 511 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   entire set of templates for a reference type, you may select a different reference type from the Reference
   Type list at the top of the window, click in the Tag cell for the new reference type, and select Paste.

   When you copy information from one reference type (such as Journal Article), and paste the rows into
   another reference type (such as Newspaper), the field names automatically change to reflect the names
   used by the new reference type. If there is not a corresponding field name in the new reference type, the
   original field name in the template is replaced with {IGNORE}, indicating that the data for that tag will be
   ignored. You can edit the new template to match the data, as needed.


Literal Text vs. EndNote Fields in Import Filters and Connection Files
   When you look at a filter, you will notice that some of the templates contain information other than EndNote
   field names. For EndNote to identify which data should go into a particular EndNote field, you must include
   punctuation and any literal text or spaces that appear in your data file. Punctuation and literal text act as
   delimiters, allowing EndNote to parse the data into multiple EndNote fields. None of these delimiters actually
   gets imported into an EndNote library, they merely serve as guides for EndNote to correctly import the data.

   Here is an example of a data file’s source line where, in addition to punctuation, there is literal text such as
   "v", "n" and "p" preceding the data:

       SO: Youth Theatre Journal. v6 n4 p3-6.

   The "v", "n" and "p" are considered literal text because they are not EndNote field names; they represent the
   literal text from the data file that precedes the data that you want to import. In this particular source line,
   there are four different pieces of information: the journal name, volume, issue, and pages. To help EndNote
   determine when one field ends and the next one begins, you must insert the literal text, punctuation, and
   spaces found in the data file next to the appropriate field name.

   As a result, the above SO: tag line should be represented in a filter like this:

        Tag              Field(s)

        SO:              Journal. vVolume nIssue pPages.

   In some databases, you may find lines of data that include a word that is also an EndNote field name. The
   following source line contains the word "pages" before the page numbers:

       SO: Town-planning-review. vol. 62, no. 4, pages461-469.

   If entered into the filter, EndNote would normally interpret the word "pages" as a field name. (This is true
   whether you type it in the filter or insert it using the Insert Field list.) To force EndNote to read a field’s name
   as literal text, surround the name with accent grave characters (`), as in `pages`. The accent grave
   character is found in the upper left corner, under the tilde (~) key on most English keyboards. To match the
   source line shown above, the source line in the filter should appear as:

        Tag              Field(s)

                         Journal. vol. Volume, no. Issue,
        SO:
                         `pages`Pages.

The {IGNORE} Field in Import Filters and Connection Files
   There may be pieces of information in a line of data that you do not want imported into your EndNote library.
   To force EndNote to ignore pieces of information, use the Insert Field list to insert {IGNORE} in the
   appropriate place. For example, suppose you want EndNote to ignore bracketed text that sometimes follows
   the title of an article:

       TI: Research funds are dwindling. [letter]

   You should add a new TI tag and template to your filter that looks like the example below. This line should
   be above the TI: Title line because this line is more complex, with added information in it. EndNote will try to
   match information to each template line with the same tag from top to bottom, so the more complex line
   goes above the simpler line.

        Tag                      Field(s)

        TI:                      Title. [{IGNORE}]


The Source Line in Import Filters and Connection Files
   The source line is typically the most complex line of data in a record because it contains all of the
   information about the source of the publication. For a journal article, the source line may contain the journal
   name, the volume number, the issue number, page numbers, and the year of publication. For a book, the
   source line may contain the publisher, the city, and the number of pages.

   The source line in your filter must match exactly the source line in the data file in order for EndNote to
   distinguish one piece of information from another. You will often find more than one variation of a source line
   for a given reference type in a single data file, in which case you will need to create a separate source line
   for each variant, starting with the most complex source. The three source lines displayed below come from a
   single database:

       SO: Semin-Oncol. 76(3):465-71 1998
       SO: Semin-Oncol. 127:5-24 1999
       SO: Eur-J-Cancer. 118/6 (654-657) 1998

   In the first SO: tag line, parentheses enclose the issue number "(3)." In the second SO: tag line, there is no
   issue, so a colon separates the volume number and the page numbers "127:5-24." In the third SO: tag line,
   a slash separates the volume number and the issue number "118/6" and parentheses enclose the page
   numbers "(654-657)."

   Each variant in the data file’s source lines must be defined in your filter. Since EndNote tries to match the
   source line in the data file with the first defined source line in your filter, you should place the most detailed
   source line first, followed by progressively less detailed source lines.

   The filter for the above source lines should look like this:

        Tag              Field(s)

        AU:              Author

        TI:              Title

        SO:              Journal. Volume(Issue):Pages Year

        SO:              Journal. Volume/Issue (Pages) Year


       Page 513 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


        SO:              Journal. Volume:Pages Year

        KW:              Keywords


    Note: If the filter fails to match a variation of the source line for a journal article, it is possible to have
    EndNote interpret the data on its own. See Source Parsing in Import Filters and Connection Files.


The Reference Type Tag in Import Filters and Connection Files
   A Reference Type tag identifies the kind of work or publication being referenced in a particular record in your
   data file. In the Filter window, a Reference Type tag is only defined by the characteristic of having literal text,
   and no fields, entered into the field column. This literal text is not imported into EndNote, but it is used only
   to identify a record’s reference type.

   Although a Reference Type tag can be any tag at all, two common Reference Type tags are "DT" and
   "PT" (which stand for Document Type and Publication Type).

       JN- Am J Occup Ther; 47 (11) p998-1008|
       CP- UNITED STATES|
       PY- Nov 1993|
       SN- 0272-9490|
       JC- 304|
       CN- MCJ-009105|
       LA- ENGLISH|
       DT- Analytic; Serial| ←Reference Type Tag
       JA- 9404|

   To ensure that EndNote imports the data into the correct reference type, you must type the Reference Type
   tag in the Tag column, and the reference type name (or other identifying text) exactly as it appears in the
   data file in the Field(s) column. (The matching is case-sensitive.) The Reference Type tag can be placed
   anywhere in the appropriate Reference Type template.

   When EndNote imports a record, it first scans the data file, looking for a Reference Type tag in your filter.
   Then it looks for a match in the record it’s importing. The first Reference Type tag match encountered
   determines which of the Reference Type templates EndNote will use to parse the record. This match also
   determines which reference type EndNote assigns the record in the EndNote library.

   When entering the Reference Type tag in your filter, the text you enter in the Field cell must be interpreted
   by EndNote as literal text. A problem can arise when you have text that contains an EndNote field name. For
   example, the following Reference Type tag contains the field name "Journal":

        Tag                      Field(s)

        DT:                      Journal Article

   Because the field name "Journal" appears in the template, EndNote will not interpret this DT: tag line as the
   Reference Type tag. Instead, the filter would import the word Journal (from the data file’s DT: line) into the
   Journal field.

   To force EndNote to interpret the word Journal (or any other field name) as literal text, put an accent grave
   (`) character at the start and end of the word. (The accent grave character is usually found in the upper left
   corner of the keyboard, under the tilde (~) key.) The above Reference Type tag should appear in a filter as:




       Page 514 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       Tag                       Field(s)

       DT:                       `Journal` Article

   If the database you use does not specify a Reference Type tag, all reference types in your data file will
   import as the default reference type (see Reference Type in Import Filters and Connection Files).


Fields with Special Characteristics
   Certain EndNote fields contain special restrictions on what sort of data can be imported. These settings
   cannot be modified and apply to all import filters.

       ▪ Author Fields: The words "And Others" get converted to "et al" and the word "and" is omitted. Years
          as well as parenthetical or bracketed text are removed by default. See Author and Editor Parsing in
          Import Filters and Connection Files.

       ▪ Year: Only 4-digit numbers (1### or 20##) are imported.
       ▪ Title: The following punctuation is removed from the end of a title.

                    Removed Characters
                      at End of Title

                .   Period

                ,   Comma

                ;   Semicolon

                :   Colon

                /   Forward slash

                \   Back slash

                (   Opening parenthesis

                -   Hyphen

               ^    Caret

       ▪ Pages: A "P" or "p" before the number is automatically removed.

       ▪ Volume: A "V" or "v" before the number is automatically removed, as is a number that appears to be
          a year.

       ▪ Issue: An "N" or "No" or "No." before the number is automatically removed (this is not case
          sensitive).


When Punctuation Repeats within a Field in Import Filters and Connection
Files
   A special formatting character called a "vertical bar" (|) can be placed in a filter to indicate a repeating
   separator within a field. For example, you may have a data file where a period followed by a space
   separates a journal name from the volume. However, in some cases, this separator is part of the journal



       Page 515 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


  name itself, with the result that a period and a space cannot be reliably used to distinguish a journal name
  from the volume. For example:

      SO:    Science. 10 (3): p. 80-90

  The above source line would be defined in a filter as:

                Tag                                     Field(s)

       SO:                      Journal. Volume (Issue): p. Pages

  Another source line in the same data file might look like this:

      SO:    Proc. Nat. Acad. 19 (5): p. 23-24

  The problem arises in the second source line where the separator between the journal and volume (period
  and a space) is found repeatedly within the journal name. The SO: line in the filter instructs EndNote to
  import the data up to the period and space into the Journal field. Consequently, EndNote would parse
  "Proc." as the journal name, and everything after the period up to the open parenthesis as the volume, so
  the volume would be "Nat. Acad. 19."

  There is a way to indicate a repeating separator within a field in the filter. If you place a vertical bar (|) before
  the separator, this instructs EndNote to read up to the last occurrence of this separator. In the example
  above, if we place a vertical bar before the repeating Journal field separator (period and space), the SO: line
  in the filter would look like this:

                Tag                                     Field(s)

       SO:                      Journal|. Volume (Issue): p. Pages



  This SO: line in this filter instructs EndNote to import all the data up until the last period followed by a space
  separator as a journal. Here, EndNote would import "Proc. Nat. Acad." as the Journal, and "13" as the
  Volume.



The Filter Options
  The remainder of the options listed in the Filter window below Templates provide the tools for fine tuning
  your filter. These options include, among other things, how author names should be interpreted, how text is
  indented in your data file, and which characters should be omitted when you import records into an EndNote
  library.

EndNote’s "Smart" Settings
  When possible, EndNote provides a Smart option for your choices in configuring the filters. Wherever you
  select a Smart option, it means that EndNote will do its best to interpret the data. If you do not know exactly
  how the reference is configured in the data file, or if there is a lot of variability among the format of the
  references, then the Smart options are probably going to be the most reliable settings. In cases where the
  Smart option does not work for your data file, you may try the other options provided for that particular
  setting.

Author and Editor Parsing in Import Filters and Connection Files
   Use the Author Parsing panel to specify how author names are arranged in your data file. These settings
   apply only to authors in EndNote’s main (Generic) Author field. The Editor Parsing panel applies to editors,
   translators, and other authors; all those that are in EndNote’s Generic Secondary Author, Tertiary Author,
   Subsidiary Author, and Translated Author fields.

Name Order

   Use the "Name Order" settings to specify the order in which first and last names are arranged in the data
   file. Examples appropriate to each setting are shown below:

       ▪ Last Always Precedes First
          AU: Smith, J.; Caton, K.; Jordan, L.

       ▪ First Always Precedes Last
          AU: J. Smith, K. Caton, L. Jordan

       ▪ Name Order is Inconsistent
          AU: Smith, J., K. Caton, L. Jordan

Interpreting First Names

   The Interpret First Names as option allows you to specify exactly how EndNote should interpret the part of
   the author name that it has identified as the first name or initials.

   The default is set to Smart, which uses the following rule: If there are three or fewer contiguous uppercase
   letters, these letters are imported as initials. Otherwise, the letters are imported as a whole name. For
   example, if the author’s name appears in the data file as:

       AU:    Childs, Jackie D.

   Smart parsing will interpret "Jackie" as the first name, and "D" as the middle initial. This author name would
   import as:

       Childs, Jackie D.

   If the author’s name appears in the data file as:

       AU:    von Braun, ED

       Page 517 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   Smart parsing will interpret ED as initials; thus the author name would import into EndNote as:

       von Braun, E. D.

   EndNote would only import ED as a first name "Ed" if you selected the Whole Names option.

   The Whole Names and Initials Only options should only be used in special cases. The Whole Names option
   should be used in the case where the authors in your data file are all uppercase (because Smart parsing
   would recognize mixed case names as full names), and full names are used. This option prevents EndNote
   from converting names consisting of two or three uppercase letters, as in "SUE" or "AL" to initials. For
   example, if the author’s name appears in the data file as:

       AU: TOBIES, SUE

   the Whole Names option would correctly import the author’s first name as "Sue." By contrast, EndNote’s
   Smart Parsing would interpret the whole name SUE as three initials, as "S.U.E. Likewise, if you select
   Initials Only, EndNote imports all first names as initials only. You would only choose this latter option if the all
   the first names in your data file are initials.

Author Name Separators

   The Author Name Separators tell EndNote how to extract the individual authors from a line containing
   several authors.

Between Authors

   The "Between Authors" option refers to the punctuation that is used to separate individual author names. It
   is extremely important that this setting is correct so that the author names import correctly into EndNote.
   Author names in an EndNote reference are listed one name per line.

   The default for the Between Authors option is set to Smart. With this option selected, EndNote looks for a
   common separator, either a semicolon (;), a carat (^) or a vertical bar (|), and uses this delimiter to identify
   where one name ends and the next name begins.

   In this example, multiple authors are separated by a semicolon:

       AU: Bunting ME; Hanzlik JR

   EndNote’s Smart parsing recognizes the semicolon separating the two author names and correctly imports
   them into an EndNote library as:

       Bunting, M. E.
       Hanzlik, J. R.

   Therefore, in this example, you do not need to change the setting. However, if your data file has a delimiter
   other than a semicolon (;), a caret (^), or a vertical bar (|) separating multiple authors, you must select
   another option from the adjacent list. To type any punctuation, such as a hyphen or a slash, select Other
   and type the character there. A space and a return (where the authors are listed one per line) can be
   selected directly from the list.

   If you select Import As Is from the list, EndNote will not try to separate the names that follow the author tag.
   Everything that follows that tag in the data file will be imported exactly as it appears in the file.

       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


Last and First Names Separator

   Once EndNote knows how to identify an individual author name in a list of authors, it looks at that name and
   tries to determine what the first name is and what the last name is. The Last & First Names separator is
   used to do this, along with the Name Order settings.

   The default Last & First Names setting is Smart. With this option selected, EndNote attempts to interpret an
   author’s name based on the following separators: a space, a comma, or a period. In your data file, if the
   separator used between the last name and the first name is something other than a space, a comma, or a
   period, you can select a separator from the adjacent list.

Parenthetical Data in Author Field

   It is not uncommon for information providers to include additional information about the authors (such as
   date of birth or institutional affiliation).

       AU: Takahashi, J (1974-); Izumi, R (1989-)

   When this information is mixed in with the list of authors on the tagged author line, EndNote provides two
   options for what to do with it.

       ▪ Discard: All parenthetical information is discarded during the import.

       ▪ Import Into: All parenthetical data mixed in with the author names is imported into the field that you
          choose. We suggest that you import it into the Notes field, Author Address, or another custom field
          that is appropriate.

    Note: It is not appropriate for EndNote to import that data into the Author field because it would produce
    an incorrectly formatted bibliography to have the parenthetical data included with the author names.


Continuation Lines in Import Filters and Connection Files
   In general, EndNote ignores lines of text which do not begin with a tag unless the lines of text are
   continuations of a previous tagged item. We call these continuation lines. Here is an abstract from a data file
   illustrating the concept of continuation lines (all but the first are considered continuation lines):

       AB- A single-subject research design that used
           multiple baselines across behaviors compared
           traditional adaptations to computers.

   Because EndNote only imports tagged lines and continuation lines, it can avoid importing extraneous text
   that might interrupt a reference, such as your logging on or logging off text. Examples of extraneous lines
   are:

       -->>Press any Key to continue

       <Record 5 of 42>




       Page 519 of 631
    Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


EndNote provides two general options for dealing with continuation lines:

    ▪ Ignore Indents: Untagged lines are always a continuation of the preceding line
       With this option set, every line of text in the data file will import according to the tags that are defined
       in the Templates panel. Do not select this option if there is any text in your data file that is not tagged.
       If you use this option and do not want to import certain tagged lines, you must use the {IGNORE}
       option (see The {IGNORE} Field in Import Filters and Connection Files).

    ▪ Continuation lines must be indented
       This option allows you to specify the exact number of spaces on the left margin for the continuation
       lines.

       The following example is an abstract where the first line of data (including the Tag, which takes three
       "spaces") begins four spaces from the left margin, and the continuation lines are indented four
       spaces, so all the data text aligns at the left. EndNote’s default Smart Indent Identification would
       import this abstract correctly. (Spaces are shown as periods (.) for clarity.)

           AB-.Two experiments compared the performance of 23 12
           ....old dyslexics with that of 8 age-matched controls on a
           ....battery of tests of motor balance. A dual-task paradigm
           ....was used: Ss performed each test as a single task and as
           ....a task concurrent with a secondary task. In all single-
           ....task conditions there was no difference between groups.

       However, you may find data files where the continuation lines are not aligned with the first line of
       data. In the following example, the continuation lines are indented two spaces from the left margin,
       whereas the first line of data (including the Tag, which takes three "spaces") begins four spaces from
       the left margin.

           AB-.Beyond the inevitability of countertransference feelings
           ..is the question of countertransference enactments. From a
           ..two-person, participant-observer or observing-participant
           ..perspective, enactments are inevitable. The analyst becomes
           ..influenced by the patient (and influences the patient as
           ..well) and enmeshed in the patient's internalized
           ..interpersonal configurations.

For EndNote to treat the subsequent lines as continuation lines in the preceding example, the filter must
specify the exact number of spaces indented on the left margin. In the example just given, you would enter
"2" in the Indented Spaces option.

If most of the lines in a data file import a fixed number of spaces (like two spaces in the example above), but
one tagged field is indented differently (perhaps keywords are indented four spaces), you can enter
exceptions in the table provided. Simply enter the number of spaces in the left column next to the tag. You
only need to enter a number for the tagged field with the inconsistent import. All other lines that are left
blank will use the general indent setting.

 Note: For a quick and reliable way to count how many spaces are inserted on the left margin, turn on the
 setting in your word processor to display formatting characters. It can also help to use a monospace, or
 "fixed width," font to display the data.

Reference Type in Import Filters and Connection Files
Default Reference Type
   The default reference type tells EndNote which reference type to use if it cannot identify the reference type
   of a record. For example, suppose that in one filter you specify Journal Article as your default reference
   type, and create a template for it. If you import a data file containing conference proceedings records for
   which you have not defined a Reference Type template, any conference proceedings records will import as
   Journal Articles. Also, if the database that you use does not specify a Reference Type tag, all reference
   types in your data file will import as your default reference type. (See The Reference Type Tag for
   information about defining the reference types tag in a template.)

    Note: The default reference type is always indicated with bold text in the Reference Types list on the
    Templates panel.


Identifiers
   Some information providers provide Identifier tags with the name of the vendor (the data provider) and the
   database.

   These identifiers are also used to import data files that contain references from multiple databases. EndNote
   can import multi-source files like that as long as each record in the data file has a vendor and a database
   tag at the start of the reference. The identifiers must also be entered into the appropriate filters in the Filters
   folder. When you are ready to import a file that has data from multiple sources in it, be sure to select the
   Multi-Filter import option in the Import dialog.

   The way that EndNote is able to know which filter to use is by these Identifier tags entered into the filter.
   Both identifiers must be used. The first identifier should be the tag that includes the name of the information
   provider. For this example it is "VN." The exact text that follows that tag for each record should be entered
   into the corresponding box in the Identifiers section. The next tag is used to identify the database, such as
   Medline or BIOSIS. Enter the tag used for the database name, and then enter the database name exactly as
   it appears in each reference.

   For example, for EndNote to read this data correctly:

       <1>
       VN - Ovid Technologies
       DB - Ovid MEDLINE(R)
       AU - Jacobson, R; Campbell, S
       PY - 1999

   For Vendor Identification, enter the Tag " VN -" and the Text "Ovid Technologies" and for Database
   Identification, enter the Tag "DB -" and the Text "Ovid MEDLINE(R)" as shown above.


Field Editing in Import Filters and Connection Files
   To access this feature, select Import Filters or Connection Files from the Tools menu. Open the Manager,
   select a filter or connection file, and then select the Edit option.

Converting Text from Uppercase to Lowercase

   If all of the text for a field in your data file appears entirely in uppercase letters, EndNote can convert the text
   to either Sentence, Headline, or Lowercase format, depending on which option you specify in the Field
   Editing panel.

   To control the lowercasing of a field, select the appropriate field from the Field Editing for list at the top of the
   window. The EndNote fields are listed here by their Generic names. Then pick a capitalization option from
   the Change UPPERCASE text to list.

   A title that appears in a data file as "COMPOST AS A HUMAN NUTRIENT AND HORMONE CARRIER"
   would import in Headline capitalization as:

       Compost as a Human Nutrient and Hormone Carrier

   or in Sentence capitalization as:

       Compost as a human nutrient and hormone carrier

   To keep a field’s text entirely in uppercase characters, select the Do NOT Lowercase option.

   You can apply lowercasing on any field as long as all the text in the field is uppercase. If any of the text in
   the field is in mixed case, EndNote will import it in mixed case.

    Note: For a list of reference type fields and their corresponding Generic field names, us the List of
    Reference Types to access the reference type settings for any predefined reference type.

   The Author, Editor, and Translator fields are treated differently from all other EndNote fields. Upon importing
   author fields into an EndNote library, these fields are automatically converted from uppercase to headline.
   Due to the special characteristics of these particular fields, the option to change the case is not available in
   the Field Editing panel.

Omitting Unwanted Characters

   Some lines of data have superfluous characters, such as an asterisk (*) or a hyphen (-), that you may not
   want to import. For example, in the following lines of data there are hyphens in the journal name, and there
   is an asterisk before each keyword:

       SO- American-journal-of-preventive-medicine; 12(9)
       DE- *COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGN; *DISPLAY DEVICES; *INTERFACES

   To prevent unwanted characters from being imported into your EndNote library, use the Field Editing panel
   to specify the characters that you want to omit:

       ▪ From the Field Editing for list, select the EndNote field that contains unwanted characters. You will
          find that the EndNote fields are listed by their Generic names. For a list of reference type fields and
          their corresponding Generic field names, use the List of Reference Types.

       ▪ Type the unwanted text in the Enter text to be omitted box, and then click Add to add it to the
          omission list.

   When you prevent characters from being imported into an EndNote field, you are omitting the characters
   from the corresponding Generic field, so the omission applies to every reference type field that corresponds
   to the particular Generic field. For example, the Secondary Title field corresponds to both the Journal field in
   a Journal Article reference type and the Series Title in a Book reference type. Therefore, if you omit a

       Page 522 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   hyphen (-) from the journal name, any hyphens found in a Series Title for a Book reference type will also be
   omitted.

   Each item that you want to omit should be entered on a separate line. For example, let’s say that you
   wanted to omit both underscores (_) and forward slashes (/) from your records’ keywords. First add the
   underscore, and then add the forward slash. Entering both items on the same line would cause EndNote to
   omit only instances of "_/", while all other instances of underscores and forward slashes would end up in
   your keywords. You can omit up to 254 characters per EndNote field.

   To remove an item from the list, select the item and click Remove. You may select more than one item by
   holding down the Shift or Ctrl key while clicking on multiple items.

    Note: The more items added to the list, the longer it takes EndNote to import records into EndNote, but it
    is generally faster than running a manual Find and Replace after import. If you would prefer to manually
    replace characters after import, see Find and Replace.


Record Layout in Import Filters and Connection Files
   Use the options in the Record Layout panel to modify how EndNote interprets the end of a reference in a
   data file.

Smart Record Identification

   Smart Record Identification, EndNote’s default setting for record termination, creates a new record in
   EndNote each time a tag in the data file repeats out of sequence and is preceded by a blank or extraneous
   line. EndNote will not create a new record if the same tag appears in succession, provided that they are not
   separated by a blank line.

   For example, some databases list authors one per tagged line, with the AU tag appearing two or more times
   in succession, as in the following example:

      AU- D'Orazio, MG
      AU- Tamura, TS

   When EndNote sees consecutive tags, it does not start a new reference unless it finds the same tag
   preceded by a blank or extraneous line.

More Specific Record Layout Options

   A more precise way of identifying a new record is to specify in your filter exactly how the records are
   terminated in your data file. The remaining options in the Record Layout panel allow you to do this.

   To determine how records are terminated, open your data file in either a word processor or text editor.
   Check for the pattern consistently separating one record from another. Once you have determined the
   correct record termination, click the appropriate button on the Record Layout panel to select the best option
   for your data file. You may choose only one option as a record terminator.

       ▪ Blank line separates records
          Select this option if the only blank lines in a data file are the ones in between references.

       ▪ Using "First Tag" and "Last Tag" Options



       Page 523 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


          This option lets you specify a first tag that starts the record and/or a final tag that ends each record.
          Only one tag is required.

           ▪ Before choosing this option as your record terminator, verify that the first or last tag is
              consistently present in each record. This option will function correctly only if the chosen tag
              appears in every record.

           ▪ You do not need to enter both a first and last tag; either tag will suffice to distinguish one record
              from the next.

           ▪ Enter the tag exactly as it appears in the data file, including the delimiter that follows the tag (for
              example, a colon or hyphen following the tag). EndNote treats these delimiters as part of their
              respective tags.

           ▪ You do not need to include these tags in the templates of your filter, unless you wish to import
              the associated data.

       ▪ Each record ends with
          Select this option if your references consistently end with a specific set of unique characters. Note
          that whatever you enter into this option needs to be unique enough that it does not appear elsewhere
          in your references. One common set of characters that is used to terminate each record is ||.

       ▪ Each record starts with
          Select this option if your references consistently start with text that is not a tag. For example, it is
          common for some information providers to begin each reference with a counter such as:

              <1>
              or
              Record 1 of 53

          In these cases, enter the text exactly as it appears in the data file, but substitute a number sign (#)
          for the actual number. For the examples above, you would enter "<#>" and "Record # of #" in the
          field.

Example

   The following example illustrates a data file that contains neither a blank line, nor text terminating each
   record. However, there is a consistent first tag, "ND:" starting each record. So for this example you would
   want to specify "ND:" to identify the beginning of a record by clicking the "First Tag" button, and typing "ND:"
   in the box.

       ND: 430529953|
       BASE: BA83|
       AU: HILDEN


Source Parsing in Import Filters and Connection Files
   The source line refers to the line in the data file that represents the source information for the journal
   (typically journal, volume, issue, pages, and sometimes the year). It is usually the most complex and
   inconsistent line of data in your data file—and it is also the most important. As a result, the EndNote filters
   provide a sort of safety net to catch inconsistently entered source data.




       Page 524 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   The tags and templates defined in the Templates panel are used first to import source data. If a source line
   in a data file does not match any of the options in the templates, then EndNote provides you with additional
   options for how to handle that. The first thing you need to do is to make sure that EndNote has correctly
   identified the journal article source tag.

Identifying the Source Tag

   If the source tag for the Journal Article reference type in the Templates section of a filter is SO or JN,
   EndNote automatically identifies this tag as the source tag. However, if the source tag defined in your filter is
   something other than a SO or JN, you must choose the appropriate tag from the Journal Article Source Tag
   list. (All of the tags that have been defined in the Journal Article template will appear in the Source Tag list.)

When Source Data and Filter Templates Do not Match

   If a journal article’s source line in your data file does not match a source line in your filter, you can choose
   how EndNote should treat the unmatched source line. The default option is Use Smart Parsing. EndNote’s
   Smart Parsing does its best to distinguish the journal name, the volume number, the issue number, the page
   numbers, and the year, and import each into the corresponding EndNote field. Any information that is not
   identified as a journal, volume, issue, pages, or year is imported into the Notes field, along with the
   comment "Using Smart Source Parsing." (After importing, if you suspect that some references may not have
   matched the defined source template, it is helpful to use EndNote’s Search command to search for the text
   "Using Smart Source Parsing" in the Notes field of the imported references. You may then check those
   records to see if EndNote correctly interpreted the data.)

   If you choose the other option, to import the source data into a separate field, EndNote does not attempt to
   parse the source information, and instead imports the entire unmatched source line into whatever field you
   have specified.

   For any reference type other than a Journal Article, unmatched source lines are automatically imported into
   the Notes field. Therefore, if you have not defined an exact match for a source line found in a book record in
   your data file, EndNote imports the entire source line into the Notes field.


Importing MARC Records
What Are MARC Records?
   "MARC" stands for Machine Readable Cataloging format. It is a standardized format developed by the U.S.
   Library of Congress for producing machine-readable bibliographic records. It is much more difficult to read
   than regular tagged data formats, but it can still be imported in much the same way using EndNote’s filters.

The MARC Format and Connection Files
   Many connection files use the MARC format because it is specified as part of the Z39.50 standard. When
   creating a new connection file, the Templates and MARC Records portions of the connection file are
   automatically set up to import standard USMARC (MARC21) data. If you need to customize these parts of
   the connection file, the instructions in this section would apply.


Example of a MARC Filter
   For a good example of the filter options used with MARC data, look at the filter sections of the connection
   file for the U.S. Library of Congress. To open this file for editing, select Connection Files > Open Connection
   Manager from the Tools menu, then select the Library of Congress file and click Edit.

Unique Aspects of MARC Records
   MARC records differ from other bibliographic records in three important ways; they include numeric tags and
   subfields, and they do not generally include line breaks.

Numeric Tags

   The primary way in which MARC records differ from non-MARC bibliographic records is in their reliance on
   numeric tags. Numeric tags typically consist of three digits, followed by one or two spaces, and one or two
   more digits. For example:

       050 00 $aPS3503.E53 $bB6 1986
       082 00 $a811/.52 $219
       100 1   $aBenét, Rosemary, $d1900-1962.
       245 12 $aA book of Americans / $cby Rosemary and Stephen Vincent Benét ;
       illustrated by Charles Child.
       260     $aNew York : $bH. Holt, $c1986.
       300     $a114 p., [1] leaf of plates : $bill. ; $c22 cm.
       490 0   $aAn Owlet book

Subfields

   The second way in which MARC tags differ from other bibliographic records is the use of subfields.

   Each numerically tagged line in a MARC record may contain any number of subfields. A subfield typically
   consists of two consecutive characters, the first of which is the subfield delimiter which denotes the start of a
   new subfield. Examples of subfields are "$a" and "$x." The subfields do not have to be consecutive.

   If you were creating a conventional filter for importing bibliographic records from a MARC database, you
   would have to anticipate a vast number of possible combinations, both of tags and of subfields.

   Because it is difficult to anticipate every possible combination of tags and subfields in MARC records,
   EndNote provides you with a simplified way of creating filters for MARC records. The two sections that
   follow tell you how to create a filter specifically for MARC records, and then alert you to the different rules
   that EndNote uses when importing MARC records into an EndNote library.

No Line Breaks

   When you save a text file from an online database, there are generally line breaks with tags at or near the
   left margin which can be used to create filter templates from. Line breaks are necessary for creating filters
   because the tag identifier is "read" in relation to the left margin. Raw MARC data has no line breaks, making
   it impossible to download most MARC data as a text file and build an import filter for it. For this reason,
   MARC data is seldom seen in import filters but common in connection files.

   When importing data through a connection file, EndNote inserts the necessary line breaks. When looking at
   the connection log, the data is shown with the line breaks EndNote has inserted, which allows the filter
   portions of connection file to be built. This means if you see an option to download a MARC file for an online
   database, it is likely you will not be able to create a filter for it, but you can use the Import command to
   import the Connect.log file created during an online search. See The Connect Log File.

       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


Creating a Filter for MARC Records

    Note: It is very rare to build an Import Filter for MARC data because raw MARC data does not include line
    breaks. Therefore, these instructions will usually be applied to the filter portion of a connection file. See
    No Line Breaks in Unique Aspects of MARC Records. See Creating Connection Files for information on
    creating a new connection file.

   Once you have created a new filter or connection file, or you have opened an existing filter or connection
   file, select the MARC Records panel.

   Click the Process data file as a MARC record checkbox. The dollar sign ($) will appear in the MARC
   Subfield Delimiter box, since this is the most common subfield delimiter. If the subfield delimiter is
   something other than a dollar sign, delete the dollar sign and type in the appropriate delimiter.

Data Start Column

   The reference data in a MARC reference normally starts in column 8 (that is, the eighth character from the
   left margin). This is the default setting you will find in the "Data starts in column" text box. If the MARC
   records in your data file start the actual reference data (as opposed to tags and subfield delimiters) in some
   other position, enter that number in the "Data starts in column" text box.

    Note: Always enter a value of 6 or higher in the "Data starts in column" text box. If you enter a lesser
    value (for example, you enter the number 5), the value will change back to 8 when you leave the Marc
    Records panel even if you have saved your changes. This only happens in the "Data starts in column"
    text box. If you make other changes, then those values are saved when you return to the Marc Records
    panel.


Accession Numbers

   The Accession Number is a unique number assigned to each record in a database (the information
   provider’s database, not the EndNote library). The provider may not call it an Accession Number; PubMed
   uses PMID, and some systems use Unique Identifier. These numbers sometimes appear immediately after
   the numeric tag, and without the two-digit subfield codes seen in other MARC fields. Since a common type
   of accession number often appears after the 001 tag, EndNote includes an Import 001 tags as Accession
   Numbers checkbox which lets you import this number into EndNote’s Accession Number field. Accession
   numbers which appear in lines other than 001 often begin with a subfield, so you can set up the filter to
   import the number into the Accession Number field.

    Note: Only one item can be imported into the Accession Number field. If the contents of the 001 field are
    imported to the Accession Number field and another tag is also set to import to the field, the data set to
    import into the field under any other tag will be ignored. If there is no data already in the Accession
    Number field, then the contents of the second tagged field will be imported.


If the First Field Has No Subfield Delimiter

   Normally the first character that precedes the record data is the subfield delimiter (commonly a dollar sign
   $). If this subfield delimiter is not present for the first field of each tagged line, you will need to tell EndNote
   how to interpret the first character by checking the appropriate option under the MARC records dialog. Is it
   part of the real data of a reference or is it a field designator (such as "a" or "b") that just happens to be
   missing the subfield delimiter?

Rules for MARC Import Filters
   EndNote observes these rules when importing MARC records:

       ▪ EndNote allows you to specify only the first three digits of the tag when designing a filter for MARC
          records. You can disregard spaces and digits appearing immediately after the first three digits. The
          tag for both of the following examples would be 245.

             245 10 $a When you realize you have too many kids:
             $b a guide / $c Hugh B
             245 14 $a The angel with a dirty mouth /$c NickSteel
             ; illustrated by Melissa

       ▪ You do not have to define all the subfields in a tagged line. There may be some subfields that
          contain information you do not want to import into your EndNote library. EndNote will ignore any
          subfields that are not defined in your filter.

       ▪ Source lines cannot take advantage of the Smart Source Parsing option. You may, however, enter
          multiple variations of the subfields in a source line. Be sure to enter all subfields after the same tag
          (do not repeat the tag for each), and list the most complex subfield formats first. For example:

             773 $gVolume(Issue), p. Pages$gVolume, p.Pages

       ▪ With the exception of the reference type tag, EndNote allows you to define a MARC tag only once;
          therefore you should include all of the subfields that contain data you want to be imported. For
          example, the following line in a filter for MARC records would successfully import any or all of the
          three lines that follow:

              Tag             Field(s)

              245             $a Title $b Title $c Notes

             245 14 $a The hollow horn : $b Bob Dylan's reception in
             the United States and Germany / $c by Dennis Anderson.
             245 10 $a Bob Dylan, spellbinding songwriter /$c Nathan
             245 00 $a Down in the groove.


Modifying an Existing Filter, an Example
   Modifying an existing filter is useful if you want to create a new filter for a different database by the same
   provider. Although some information providers offer radically different formats for their different databases,
   there are others who provide fairly consistent tags and organized data across their databases.

   Common reasons for editing a filter include adding a tag to import additional information; removing a tag or
   using {IGNORE} to omit unwanted data; or fine-tuning the current settings for importing authors or journal
   source data. The specifics about how to work with templates and options are described earlier in this
   chapter. This example is intended to provide a general overview of the process of editing a filter.


Adding a Tag and Field to a Filter
   Let’s say that you want to modify a filter to import the language of the publication into EndNote’s
   Language field. In this hypothetical database, the language is preceded by the tag LA-.

      DT- Journal |

  To add the LA- tag and direct its contents to the Language field:

     1. From the Tools menu select Import Filters > Open Filter Manager.

     2. In the Filter Manager, select the filter that you want to edit, and then click Edit. (Editing the most
        recently used filter will also appear as an option in the Import Filters submenu.)

     3. Select the Templates option in the left panel of the window to open the Templates panel.

     4. Click the mouse in any cell of the Journal Article template, and then press Enter to create a new row.
        (Tags do not need to be in the same order as in the original data.)

     5. Type LA- in the Tag cell (including any preceding spaces), and then press the Tab key to move to the
        Field(s) cell. Insert the Language field from the Insert Field list. Doing so tells EndNote to import the
        language information following the LA- tag into EndNote’s Language field.

     6. You can add the LA- tag to the remaining Reference Type templates in the filter. Use the Reference
        Type list to switch to each reference type template in your filter and repeat the process described
        above. (Reference types with check marks next to them in the list are the ones that have templates
        defined for them.

     7. From the filter's File menu, select Save As. Enter a new name for the modified version of the filter,
        and then click Save.


Creating a New Filter
  This topic provides a general overview of how to create a new filter. For more information, you can also view
  an example of a data file, and the templates portion of a filter to match it (see Example Data File and
  Template).

  The basic steps to create a new filter are:

     1. From the Tools menu, select Import Filters, and then select New Filter.

     2. In the About This Filter panel, enter a category for the filter (usually the information provider is used
        for the category), and any other comments about what the filter is based on or instructions on how to
        save the data.

     3. Click on the Templates option.




      Page 529 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      4. From the Reference Types list, select the first reference type that you would like to define, and enter
         the necessary tags and the corresponding fields into the reference type template. See the Sample
         Record from a Data File for sample fields you can use to build your template. Also see Working with
         Filter Templates.

      5. Define additional reference types, as necessary, by selecting them from the Reference Types list and
         entering the tags and fields for them as well.

      6. Click the Reference Type option in the list of panel names, and select the default reference type for
         the filter.

   If this were a real filter, you might have entered enough information at this point to use the filter successfully.
   You could try it out by choosing it as the import option to import your data file into a new, empty library. You
   would review the imported references to be sure that they imported correctly. If they did not, you could fine
   tune the filter as necessary (see The Filter Options).

    Notes: It's a good idea to create an empty testing library for importing when working on a filter, to limit the
    chance of importing poor data into your working library. After you have perfected your filter, you can use it
    to import into your regular library.

    If you need a reference type that does not appear in the Reference Type list, see Adding, Changing, and
    Hiding Reference Types.

   For additional help, see Tips for Entering Tags and Fields and Example Data File and Template.


Tips for Entering Tags and Fields

       ▪ Not every tag in your data file needs to be in your filter.
          There is no need to define every tag that appears in your data file, provided that the contents of the
          corresponding field start on the same line as the tag itself; and the records’ continuation lines are not
          flush left. If you need to define every tag that appears in a record, but only want to import the
          information associated with certain tags, insert the {IGNORE} field from the Insert Field list where
          appropriate.

            Note: You do not need to specify all data fields, unless each tag appears on a line by itself, with
            the data starting below it on the next line. You may also want to specify all tags if the continuation
            lines in your records are flush left, in which case an undefined tag appearing immediately after a
            continuation line will be read in as text.


       ▪ You might need to enter multiple variations of a source line.
          You will often find more than one variation of a source line for a given reference type in a database,
          in which case you will need to define a separate source line in your template for each such variant.
          The most complex source line should appear first, followed by source lines of decreasing complexity.
          In the case of Journal Articles, be sure to specify the appropriate Source Parsing option (see Source
          Parsing in Import Filters and Connection Files).

          MARC formats are an exception. See Rules for MARC Import Filters.

       ▪ A colon, hyphen, space, or other character that appears along with a tag is treated as part of the tag.




       Page 530 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


          When defining tags in a filter, these characters need to be included in the tag column of the filter for
          EndNote to find an exact match. If spaces are inserted within a tag, they need to be defined as part
          of the tag as well. See Tags and Fields in Import Filters and Connection Files.

       ▪ Using a monospace font to view data files can help you count spaces which will need to be included
          in the template.

          Monospace, or fixed width, fonts are fonts where each letter takes up the same amount of space;
          proportional fonts are fonts where thinner letters, such as i or l, take up less space than wider letters,
          such as m or w. With proportional fonts, the size of spaces are not the same size as letters, making it
          easy to miscalculate the number of spaces used in tags or text. Examples of monospace fonts are
          Courier New, Lucida Sans Typewriter, and MS Mincho, among others.


Example Data File and Template
   Below is a modified sample of a record from PubMed Central, along with a matching sample filter
   template for a Journal Article reference type. See Working with Filter Templates for details about configuring
   templates.

   Red periods (.) in the text indicate spaces. They are colored red to differentiate them from periods included
   in the original text.

   To create a template for the Journal Article reference type in a new filter:

      1. Select Journal Article from the Reference Types list.

      2. Type "PT..-" (red periods indicate spaces) in the first tag cell, then press Tab to move to the Field
         column. Insert "Journal Article" as the first field typing it exactly as entered in the data. This is the tag
         identifying the reference type and tells EndNote that any record with "Journal Article" following the
         PT tag should be imported using the Journal Article template.

      3. Press Enter to move to the next line.


       Page 531 of 631

   4. Type the next tag to import and insert the corresponding field. Continue entering the rest of the tags
      and fields until all of the necessary information is covered by the filter. Skip or use {IGNORE} in the
      Field(s) column for any tags that you are not interested in importing.

This is what the resulting Templates panel of the filter should contain:

Connection Files
Introduction to Connection Files
   The Online Search command on EndNote’s Tools menu, and the Online Search groups, connect you to
   online databases and library catalogs so that you can search them from within the EndNote program and
   retrieve references directly into EndNote. EndNote is able to make these connections using the information
   stored in the thousands of individual connection files.

   This section describes how to edit and create connection files. The process of using the Online Search
   command is described in Searching an Online Database.

   EndNote provides thousands of connection files for a variety of sources. By default, only the most popular
   connection files are stored in the Connections folder in your EndNote folder. You can view all available
   connection files by selecting Connection Files > Open Connection Manager from the Tools menu.

   To install additional connection files, see Installing Additional Connection Files.


What is a Connection File?
   A connection file contains all the information necessary to connect to, search, and import references from an
   online database or online library catalog. Each connection file represents a different online database (such
   as the U.S. Library of Congress or PubMed from the National Library of Medicine).


The Connection Manager
   EndNote provides thousands of connection files for a variety of sources. By default, only the most popular
   connection files are stored as individual files in the Connections folder in your EndNote program folder. To
   install additional connection files, see Installing Additional Connection Files.

   To access the Connection Manager, select Connection Files > Open Connection Manager from the Tools
   menu.

   The Connection Manager lists the names of all of the original connection files available in the \\Program
   Files (x86)\EndNote 2025\Connections folder as well as any new or modified connection files in your
   personal Connections folder, and gives you the options to edit them or select them as "favorites" for quick
   access in the Online Search group set. You can click and drag the corner of the dialog to increase the size.


Locating the Connection File You Want to Use

       ▪ If you know the name of the connection file that you want to use, start typing it to select the first file
          that matches what you type.

       ▪ Click Find by and select an information provider’s name (such as OvidSP or OCLC) to find only the
          connection files for a specific information provider.

       ▪ Click Find by and select All Connections to return all of the connection files to the displayed list.



       Page 533 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       ▪ Click the column headings to sort the connection files by name or by information provider. Clicking
          the same column heading a second time will change the sort order from ascending to descending.
          Click again to set it back to ascending order.

       ▪ Click the More Info button at the bottom of the dialog to display additional information about the
          selected connection file. Click Less Info to hide the additional information.


Marking Your Favorite Connection Files
   When you have found a connection file that you will want to use in the future, click the checkbox next to it to
   mark it as a favorite. All connection files (up to 500) that are marked as favorites appear as an Online
   Search group set in the Library window. This gives you easy access to the files you use most often.

   An easy way to mark a whole category of connection files (such as all of the connections for OvidSP
   databases) is to click Find by and choose a category from the list. Then, with just that subset of connection
   files listed in the Filter Manager window, click Mark All. The Unmark All option may be used to unmark all of
   the connection files that are showing in the list.


Saving Connection Files
   To save a new connection file that you have just created, or to save changes to a connection file you have
   just modified, select Save As from the connection file's File menu.

   If you have modified one of the original installed files in the \\Program Files (x86)\EndNote 2025
   \Connections folder, you must use Save As to save a copy to your personal Connections folder. If you have
   modified a connection file that is already located in your personal Connections folder, you can select either
   Save to directly modify the file, or Save As to make a copy with the changes. For a description of where
    your styles are stored, see Folder Locations Preferences.

   EndNote automatically saves new connection files to your personal Connections folder. You may also
   specify a different folder, if necessary. For instructions see Folder Locations Preferences.

   EndNote connection files use the file name extension of .enz, as in "Medline (OvidSP).enz."


Copying Connection Files
   When you display a list of connection files in EndNote, the list is comprised of the installed connection files
   found in the \\Program Files (x86)\EndNote 2025\Connections folder, as well as new or modified connection
   files found in your personal Connections folder. For an explanation of where your files are stored, see Folder
   Locations Preferences.

   There are two ways to copy connection files. Since each connection file is a separate file on your hard drive,
   you can copy them as you would copy any file on your hard drive using the File Explorer.

   To make a copy of a connection file from within EndNote:

      1. From the Tools menu, select Connection Files, and then select Open Connection Manager.

      2. Select the connection file you want to copy and click Edit.

      3. Without making any changes to the connection file, select Save As from the connection file's File
         menu.



       Page 534 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      4. Give this copy of the connection file a new name, and then save it.

   The file is saved in your personal Connections folder. The new connection file will remain open. The original
   connection file will be left untouched.


Deleting Connection Files
   To delete a Connection File from within EndNote:

      1. From the Tools menu, select Connection Files > Open Connection Manager.

      2. Right-click on the connection file to be deleted and select Delete Connection… from the menu, or
         press the Delete key.

      3. You will be asked for a confirmation of if you really want to delete the connection file. Select Yes to
         delete the connection file or No to keep it.

   You can also delete an unwanted connection file by opening File Explorer and opening the appropriate
   Connections folder (see Folder Locations Preferences). Then, drag the connection file from the Connections
   folder to the Recycle Bin, or select the file and press the Delete key.

    Note: You must have read/write access to the Connections folder in order to delete a Connection File. If
    you do not have administrator access, you likely will not be able to delete a file located within the Program
    Files (x86) folder.



Basic Components of a Connection File
   Topics describing the basics of a connection file are listed below. This information is useful if you want to
   modify or create a connection file. To create a new connection file, see Creating Connection Files.

       ▪ Editing a Connection File

       ▪ The Connection Editor Window

       ▪ About this Connection

       ▪ The Connection Settings

       ▪ Search Attributes in Connection Files

       ▪ Filter Information in Connection Files

Editing a Connection File
   To edit a connection file:

       1. From the Tools menu, select Connection Files > Open Connection Manager.

       2. Select the file to edit, and then click Edit.




       Page 535 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


          The most recently used connection file can also be easily edited by selecting Connection Files from
          the Tools menu, and then selecting Edit [connection_file_name].

      3. Make your changes to the connection file.

      4. If you are editing one of the original, installed connection files:

          a. From the connection file's File menu, select Save As (the Save command will not be available).

          b. Name the file and click Save.

      5. If you are editing a connection file that you created, select Save from the connection file's File
         menu.

  EndNote saves the file in your personal Connections folder. For a description of where connection files are
  stored, see Folder Locations Preferences.


The Connection Editor Window
  After choosing the option to edit an existing connection file or create a new one, EndNote opens the
  Connection Editor window.

  All of the different panels of the Connection Editor are listed on the left side of the Connection Editor. Click
  on an item to view the associated settings. You may switch between panels as needed while editing the file.
  No changes are saved in any of the panels until you select Save or Save As from the connection file's File
  menu.

  To close the Connection File, select Close Connection from the connection file's File menu or click the Close
  button in the top right corner of the window.


About this Connection
  When the Connection Editor opens, it displays the About this Connection panel. This panel contains
  descriptive information about the connection file, and has no impact on establishing the connection.

  Name: Displays the name of the file as it appears in the Connections folder of the EndNote folder. The file
  name extension (.enz) is not displayed. The name of the connection file cannot be changed here; you would
  need to close this window and switch back to the File Explorer to rename the file.

  Based On: Enter any information about what documentation was used to create the connection file.
  Commonly the server documentation is available on the Web, so you could enter a URL here to make it
  easy to later retrieve that information. If this connection file is a modified copy of another connection file, it
  may be helpful to enter the name of the original file in this field for future reference.

  Category: The category is typically the information provider (such as OvidSP or OCLC), but you may enter
  anything that will help you categorize and organize your connection files. The category information is also
  listed in the Connection Manager window in the column next to the name of the file. In that window, you may
  sort connection files by category and also search for them by category.

  Created: The date the connection file was installed or created.

  Comments and Limitations: Enter any useful comments here that would help you remember how to
  search the online database. Limitations to preconfigured connection files may be documented here as well.

  All of the information in this panel is visible in the Connection Manager if you click the More Info button at
  the bottom of the Connection Manager window. This is helpful because you do not need to edit a connection
  file to view the comments or other descriptive information. You may scroll through the available connection
  files in the Connection Manager window and view the information there.


The Connection Settings
  Click Connection Settings to view the panel where the data to establish a connection is stored. The
  Connection Settings information is required for EndNote to be able to connect to the online database. These
  terms and descriptions are part of the Z39.50 standard.

  Server Description: The name of the information provider or institution. EndNote displays this name in the
  title of the Retrieved References window and it is also listed in the Connection Manager window. This
  information is not used to establish the connection.

  Server Address: The server address for the online database. This can be either a numerical IP address or
  a URL.

  Database Description: The name used to refer to the online database. This name is displayed in the Title
  bar of the Retrieved References window to help you identify the database to which you are connected. It is
  not used to establish the connection.

  Database Name: The file name command used to select the database on the remote server. This is not the
  name you would use to talk about the database; it is a command for "starting up" the exchange of
  information with the database.

  Element Set Name: This is normally F for Full or B for Brief. The Element Set Name determines the amount
  of information that is provided by the server for each retrieved reference. Not all servers support both
  options, and the fields returned for each option also vary. For most databases, the Full option is preferred.

  Port ID: The TCP/IP port at the server that is used for a Z39.50 connection. The two most popular ports are
  210 and 7090, but other ports can be used. The port to be used is controlled by the server and EndNote
  must match it. These are not the same ports used by your browser, except for the PubMed and Web of
  Science Core Collection connection files. Because they are not used by browsers, they are frequently
  blocked by network firewalls. See Problems Connecting.

  Batch Download: EndNote typically retrieves references in batches, for speed and memory reasons.
  However, some servers are too slow, or their record data is too large, to support batch downloads. You will
  need to turn batch processing off for such sites. If you are having trouble downloading from a site, you can
  try deselecting this option.

  Record Syntax: Many formats used by Z39.50 servers are supported by EndNote, such as UNIMARC
  (Universal Machine Readable Cataloging), SUTRS (Simple Unstructured Text Record Syntax), and OPAC
  (Online Public Access Catalog). When you create a new connection file, it is set up for the MARC21 format.
  For other formats, the filter section for connection files must be constructed manually. UNIMARC and OPAC
  use variations of the MARC format (OPAC commonly adds holdings data). The SUTRS format, because it is
  "unstructured," does not have a standard format among different databases. The SUTRS format often uses
  tags (such as "AU" or "Author") to identify the reference data. Check with your database provider for the
  appropriate settings.




      Page 537 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   Text: The Text option is used to specify how EndNote should interpret the incoming text characters. Options
   include ANSEL, Unicode (UTF-8), Unicode (UTF-16), and many other language choices. If you do not have
   the correct setting, extended characters may import as asterisks, or may be dropped completely. Check with
   your database provider for the appropriate setting.

   Login Information Required: This section is divided into four separate options: User ID, Password, Group
   ID, and Custom. Select the options required to login to the online database in order to have EndNote prompt
   you for that information when you connect. You can also store your password and/or IDs in the connection
   file so that you do not have to enter them each time you connect. Simply type the password or ID into the
   box provided.

    Notes: Passwords and IDs may be saved in the connection file for convenience, but do so at your own
    risk: passwords are not protected or encrypted. If someone else copies or uses your connection file, they
    will be able to use your stored password.

    The password and User ID requested by the host will generally not be your personal password and ID. It
    is usually the User ID and password assigned to your institution (the exception to this might be if your
    institution has a local copy of the database). These institutional User IDs and passwords are usually not
    shared with individuals within an institution. However, access may be granted to anyone connecting to the
    database from an IP address within the institution. If you are off-site and cannot access a database that
    you could access when onsite, use VPN to connect to your institution's network first, then try the
    connection file again. If you do not have VPN access to your institution's network, check with your
    network administrator.


Custom ID Authentication String

   Sometimes a database server requires a custom format for presenting the password and IDs. For these
   situations, you may skip the regular password or ID option, check the "Custom" option, and enter the text
   specified by your server’s Z39.50 documentation. You may either enter your actual password and ID along
   with the text, or use one of the following placeholders to have EndNote prompt you for the necessary
   items: ?PASSWORD, ?USERID, ?GROUPID.

   For example, a system may require that passwords be presented by Z39.50 clients in the following manner:

         pass=?PASSWORD/ dla_ui=yes

   If you wanted to store your password ("abc123" for this example) it would look like this:

         pass=abc123/ dla_ui=yes


Search Attributes in Connection Files
   The Search Attributes section of a connection file contains a table that defines the various search options for
   a particular database.

       ▪ Search Field Name: The first column identifies the name of a search. This is the word or phrase that
          appears in the menus in the Search dialog.

          Use EndNote’s Generic field names as the search field names whenever possible. Doing so makes it
          easier to have a search apply to various online sources and local EndNote libraries.

          EndNote’s preconfigured connection files often use parenthetical text after the search field name to
          help describe the search, if necessary. This parenthetical text is not considered part of the search
          field name when you change the focus of the search and EndNote looks for a matching search field


       Page 538 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


          name. See Changing the Focus of the Search. Also see The Generic Fields for a list of Generic field
          names.

       ▪ Attributes: The rest of the items in a particular row are the various search attributes that control
          what index is being used for the search, and how the search term is interpreted.

What Is an Attribute?

   A Z39.50 search attribute is a value used to define the characteristics of a search term. For example, if
   your search term is "ebola virus," the various attributes would be sent to the server along with that term to
   tell the server where to look for "ebola virus" and what qualifies as a matching reference.

   Available attributes, as defined by the Z39.50 standard, are:

      1. Use: The index to be searched (such as Keywords)

      2. Relation: The relation of the search term to the index (such as equal, greater than, or less than)

      3. Position: The position of the search term in the MARC record field (first, last, anywhere, and so on)

      4. Structure: The structure of the term, such as a word or phrase

      5. Truncation: Available truncation options used to interpret the search term (for example: right
         truncation, wildcards, no truncation)

      6. Completeness: Indicates whether or not the search term should be the complete subfield in the
         MARC record corresponding to the field searched

   The "Use" attribute is the most important here, indicating which index will be searched to find the search
   term. The other attributes will all have varying default values for each online database. These options are
   most often left blank to use the server’s defaults, but the default attribute values can be overridden by
   entering another value for the attribute. See Using Search Attributes for more information on
   customizing the search attributes.

   Each database has its own supported subset of Use attributes and associated combinations of the other
   attributes. Consult the configuration information for the online database to determine which values for these
   attributes are supported. Clarivate does not provide this information. You will need to obtain it from the
   organization (or information provider) that maintains the server.

Using Search Attributes

   Search attributes control the query that is sent to the server. They are independent of the information that
   will be sent back. Think of these as being how you ask the question. You can ask a general question or a
   very detailed question, depending on the attributes you use. Different databases will support different sets of
   attributes, so you may need to experiment with these settings. Most of the time, using the default settings
   will fit your needs, and to use those you can simply leave most of the fields blank. You can use the
   information below to customize the search attributes, but please remember that the Z39.50 server you are
   connecting to controls which attributes it will accept.

The Use Attribute

   This attribute describes what type of information is being searched for. It’s easy to think of this as just the
   field being searched, but it is more detailed than that. For example, Use value 1 equals a personal name, so
   you might use it when searching for a person’s name but not a corporation’s name. Use attribute 2 equals a



       Page 539 of 631
        Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


    corporate name. Not all use attributes will be supported for all databases. When you create a new, blank
    connection file it will be prepopulated with the most commonly-used use attributes, but can then be edited.

    For a detailed list of Use attributes, see https://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/defns/bib1.html.

The Relation Attribute

    EndNote does not support editing this field.

The Position Attribute

    The position attribute specifies the location of the search term within the field or subfield in which it appears.
    The options are—

        ▪ 1 = First in field: The search term must be the first data in the field.

        ▪ 2 = First in subfield: The search term may appear in any subfield but must be the first data in the
           subfield.

        ▪ 3 = Any position in field: The search term may appear anyplace in the field.
The Structure Attribute

    The structure attribute specifies the type of search term, for example a single word or a phrase.

        ▪ 1 = Phrase: One or more groups of characters separated by blanks, in exactly the order they are
           entered.

        ▪ 2 = Word: A group of characters with no blanks.

        ▪ 3 = String: The entire term is to be treated as a string, rather than a sequence or set of individual
           words. An example might be a telephone number with blanks within it.

        ▪ 4 = Word List: One or more groups of characters separated by blanks, in which there is no implied
           order.

The Truncation Attribute

    Truncation determines if one or more characters may be omitted when matching the search term. The
    effects of truncation vary depending on what the structure attribute is set to, as explained below.

        ▪ 1 = Right Truncation:
           Word or Phrase: Last word of the term is right truncated.
           String: Entire term is right truncated.
           Word List: Each word is right truncated.

        ▪ 2 = Left Truncation:
           Word or Phrase: First word of the term is left truncated.
           String: Entire term is left truncated.
           Word List: Each word is left truncated.

        ▪ 3 = Left and Right Truncation:
           Word or Phrase: First word of term is left truncated and last word of term is right truncated.
           String: Entire term is left and right truncated.
           Word List: Each word is left and right truncated.



        Page 540 of 631
        Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


        ▪ 100 = Do Not Truncate: No truncation is applied.
The Completeness Attribute

        ▪ 1 = Incomplete Subfield: Words other than those in the search term may appear in the subfield or
           field in which the term appears.

        ▪ 2 = Complete Subfield: No words other than those in the search term should appear in the entire
           subfield in which the term appears, but additional words may appear in other subfields in the field.

        ▪ 3 = Complete Field: No words other than those in the search term should appear in the entire field
           in which the term appears.

Tip for Editing Search Attributes

    When modifying the search attributes in a connection file, it is useful to first test the search with the new
    attribute combination before actually changing the connection file. If you are an advanced user and familiar
    with Z39.50 terminology, you can do this by entering the new attribute values using the command-line
    search method. This lets you test new attribute combinations without having to edit and save the connection
    file, and then reconnect to the server every time you want to test a modification. See Using the Z39.50
    Command-Line Syntax.

    You can find more information on Z39.50 search attributes at https://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/defns/
    bib1.html.


Filter Information in Connection Files
    The Filter section of the connection file contains the information used to import each reference and get the
    reference data into the correct EndNote fields.

    For most connection files, the filter is set up to interpret references in the MARC format. When you create a
    new connection file, the Filter section will be set up to interpret references in a standard MARC21 format.

    This part of the connection file is identical to the regular Import Filter window. For more information about
    editing a filter, consult Importing MARC Records and Working with Filter Templates.

    If the retrieved references are not importing the way you would like, you should compare the filter settings of
    the connection file to the original text that EndNote receives from the online database. To do so, select
    Show Connection Status from the Tools menu when retrieving references. Set the view in the Status window
    to show Record Data and compare the record data to what is in the filter.

    The connection record data is also stored in the Connect.log file. See The Connect Log File for information
    on file location and how to import the log file. Importing the log file allows you to test new filter templates
    without having to connect to the online database repeatedly.


Creating Connection Files
    Before you begin actually creating or modifying a connection file, you must obtain the Z39.50 client
    configuration instructions for the database you want to access. Contact your librarian or information provider
    for this information.




        Page 541 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   Note: If the database is not available on a Z39.50 server, you will not be able to use EndNote’s Online
   Search feature to access it directly. Instead, use the Import feature to import references that have been
   downloaded to text files. See Importing Reference Data into EndNote.

   Once you have the Z39.50 client configuration information in hand, follow these steps to create a new
   connection file:


Create the File and Enter the Basic Information

      1. From the Tools menu select Connection Files, and then select New Connection….

      2. A new window opens called "Untitled Connection" and displays the About this Connection panel.
         Enter any comments or descriptions here for your own use. (These comments do not affect how the
         connection functions.)

      3. Click on the Connection Settings option and enter the connection information. (See The Connection
         Settings.)

      4. Click on the Search Attributes option to modify the default search attributes, if necessary.
         (See Search Attributes in Connection Files and Using Search Attributes.)

      5. From the connection file's File menu, select Save As. Name the new connection file and save it. It
         will be saved in your personal Connections folder. To change the location your connection files are
         saved, see Folder Locations Preferences.

      6. (Optional) If you would like to add your new connection to your Favorites list, select Connection Files
         > Open Connection Manager from the Tools menu to open the Connection Manager. Locate your
         new connection file and mark the checkbox next to it to add it to your Favorites list. It will then appear
         in the Online Search group set.


Test the Connection and Searching

      1. From the Tools menu, select Online Search and select your new connection file, or select it from the
         Online Search group set if you have made it a Favorite. If the connection cannot be established,
         check the settings in the Connection Settings panel of the connection file, save your changes, and
         try again. If you still have trouble connecting, see Problems Connecting and Problems Finding the
         Host.

      2. If the connection was established, the Search panel should open automatically. Enter a simple
         search to see if the search attributes were correctly configured. If the Search does not work correctly
         or it returns an error, check the Search Attributes settings in the connection file. (If you modify the
         connection file at this point, you must save the connection file, then close the Retrieved References
         window and reconnect in order for your changes to take effect.)


Test the Filtering of Reference Data

      1. Once you are able to connect and search, retrieve a dozen or so references to test how accurately
         they are filtered into EndNote references. Double-click a retrieved reference to open it to verify that
         the data are in the correct fields.

          Note that if you are paying for the references you retrieve, these may not come through correctly, so
          it is best to retrieve only a few. All references retrieved are saved to a connection log file, so they are



      Page 542 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


          not lost and can be used for testing your filter changes without reconnecting to the online database.
          This log file is replaced the next time you open EndNote.

      2. If the reference data is not being correctly filtered into the appropriate fields in the EndNote
         references, you will need to compare the downloaded data to the filter templates in your connection
         file.

          Open the Connect.log file in a word processor to view the original format of the retrieved references.
          See The Connect Log File for information on locating the log file and importing its contents to test
          your filter without needing to reconnect to the online database.

      3. From the Tools menu, select Connection Files, and then select Edit [Your_Connection_File] to edit
         the newly created connection file. Look at the Templates panel of the connection file and compare
         the templates there to the reference data in the Connect.log file. Make changes as necessary.
         See Creating a Filter for MARC Records and Working with Filter Templates for information about
         modifying filters.


Default Values for New Connection Files
   When creating a new connection file, a few basic search attributes are entered by default. It is not
   guaranteed that these will work, as each database may only support its own subset of the Z39.50 attributes.

   Consult the Z39.50 client configuration instructions from your information provider or your librarian to set up
   the connection file correctly for the online database you want to access.

Default settings for a new connection file are:

       Port ID: 210

       Element Set Name: F (Full)

       Record Syntax: MARC21

       Text: ANSEL

       Search Fields (Use Attributes): Any Field (1016), Author (1003), Year (31), Title (4), and Subject (21).

       Filter: MARC21 filter settings are used. Templates are defined for the following reference types.

              ▪ Artwork
              ▪ Audiovisual Material
              ▪ Book
              ▪ Computer Program
              ▪ Electronic Book
              ▪ Generic
              ▪ Manuscript
              ▪ Map
              ▪ Patent
              ▪ Thesis
              ▪ Web Page

       Page 543 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      See Working with Filter Templates and Importing MARC Records for information on creating filters
      for additional reference types.


Using the Z39.50 Command-Line Syntax
   Note: This topic is intended only for people who are familiar with Z39.50 terminology and have access to
   the Z39.50 client configuration information for their online databases. The advanced search strategies are
   documented here only for more technical EndNote users; this knowledge is not required for basic
   searching of online databases. These command-line searches do not work with PubMed or the Web of
   Science Core Collection connection files.

  It is possible to set up a search of an online database that is not supported by the EndNote Search panel or
  the connection file you are using. For instance, if you know about the Z39.50 attributes supported by the
  online database, you can enter a Z39.50 search which EndNote passes directly to the server, without any
  translation. This lets you use searches that are not already supported by your connection file and is useful
  for testing various search attribute combinations when creating or modifying a connection file.

  These advanced searches are entered directly into the search line just as you would enter a search term.
  EndNote ignores the search menu for that item when it detects that you have entered an advanced search.
  If other search terms are needed, enter them into the subsequent search lines and select the appropriate
  AND, OR, or NOT connectors (just like any other search).

  An advanced search uses the following format:

      \\search term&/ATTRIBUTE TYPE/ATTRIBUTE VALUE

  The first two characters (\\) tell EndNote this is an advanced search of an online database. The next part, up
  to the ampersand (&), is the search term. The numbers of the Z39.50 attribute type and values follow. They
  are entered first with a slash and the number for the attribute type, then a slash, and the attribute’s value.
  Repeat that pattern for as many attributes as you want to specify. Not all attributes need to be included. See
  Using Search Attributes.

  The following is a common search example that should work for most servers. This search, looking in Any
  Field and using the Contains operator, should find all references in which the title begins with "child."

      \\child&/1/4/3/1/5/100

      ▪ A Use attribute (1) of 4 has been specified, so the search will be restricted to the Title for this
         database.

      ▪ A Position attribute (3) of 1 further narrows the search by having the search term be found as the first
         word in the field.

      ▪ A Truncation attribute (5) of 100 specifies no truncation.

   Note: Even if a search, such as the one above, is restricted to the Title field, you may see records
   downloaded that do not have the search term in the Title field of the record. This is because the Title (4)
   Use attribute is not searching only the main Title field, but all fields considered titles, such as series titles.
   If the term is found in a field that is not included in your filter, you may not see the term appear in your
   record at all.

Tip for Modifying Search Attributes
   If you wanted to test how variations of the search attribute settings would impact your search, here’s an
   easy way to do it— without having to edit your connection file.

      1. With the connection already established, select Show Connection Status from the Tools menu. Keep
         the view set to Status Messages.

      2. Start with a basic search using the Search panel (without the command-line syntax). For example,
         search for "child" in the Title field.

      3. Look in the Status window, and you will see which attributes are being used. For example:

             Searching for: [child&/1/4/3/3/4/2/5/100|]
             (The complexity of what you see will depend on the Search Attribute settings in the connection
             file. This example shows looking for the word "child" in the Title field, in any position in the field,
             as a word, with no truncation.)

      4. You can copy the search command out of the Status window, and paste it onto the Search panel
         (remember to add the "\\" prefix to identify it as a command-line search), then add or modify the
         attribute values as necessary.

      5. Click Search to try out your new combination of attributes.

      6. When you have found a combination of search attributes that does what you need, edit your
         connection file and make those changes to the Search Attributes panel.

   subject bibliography settings, and Cite While You Write settings. Some preferences are stored in user-
   specific folders; this allows multiple users to access a single library while preserving each user’s preferred
   settings. The preferences folders listed below store files such as the connect.log file created during an
   online search, the RefTypeTable.xml file that contains reference type definitions, and a Searches folder that
   contains saved search strategies.

   Windows 10 and 11: C:\Users\User Name\ App Data\Roaming\EndNote


Change Case Preferences
   To access these settings, go to the Edit menu, select Preferences, and then click Change Case in the list of
   preferences.

   EndNote styles can be configured to change the capitalization of the author names or titles. Use the Change
   Case preferences to list the words that should not be modified when EndNote changes the case of titles.
   This can be used for special acronyms, equations, proper nouns, or compound names that require
   consistent capitalization.

   For titles, this preference is used only when an output style is set up to apply "Headline style capitalization"
   or "Sentence style capitalization" (rather than "Leave titles as entered").

       ▪ To add words to the list, enter the term in the text box at the top of the dialog, and then click Add.

       ▪ To remove an item from the list, select the term and click Remove.

Where This Information Is Saved

   The list of terms entered into the Change Case preferences panel is stored in the C:\Users\[Your Folder]
   \AppData\Roaming\EndNote\ENCase.txt file. For a quick way to duplicate the lists for another computer
   running EndNote, copy this file to the same location on the other computer.

Display Fields Preferences
   Use the Display Fields preferences to choose which fields to display in EndNote’s Library window. These
   settings apply to all libraries opened on the computer under the same User account.

   To access these settings, go to the Edit menu, select Preferences, and then click Display Fields in the list of
   preferences.

   Select the desired field from each Field list. You may select up to ten fields to display in the Library window.
   To show fewer than ten fields, select [Do not display] instead of a field name.

   By default, the first column in the Library window displays a File Attachment indicator followed by:

       ▪ Author

       ▪ Year

       ▪ Title

       ▪ Journal

       ▪ Last Updated

       ▪ Reference Type
   In most cases, the column heading in the Library window is the same as the Generic name of the field.
   Exceptions to this rule include the Figure field, which is indicated by a figure icon fig. header and the File
   Attachments field, which is headed by a paper clip icon. If you would like to change the name for the Library
   window display, enter a new name in the Heading column next to the chosen field.

Display All Authors in the Author Field

   If you would like to display all author names under the Author heading column in the library reference list,
   select the Display all authors in the Author field checkbox. For all new installations, this is the default setting.

   If this option is not marked, only the last name of the first author will appear in the Reference List.


Display Font Preferences
   The Display Fonts panel gives you the option of changing the font size that EndNote uses to display text
   throughout the program.


Duplicates Preferences
   The Duplicates preferences panel sets criteria for the Find Duplicates command on the Library menu (that
   command is described in Finding Duplicate References).

   To access these settings, go to the Edit menu, select Preferences, and click Duplicates in the list of
   preferences.




       Page 548 of 631

Compare References

   By default, EndNote identifies duplicate references in a library as references of the same reference type with
   matching Author, Year, and Title fields. Use this panel to customize the way EndNote identifies duplicate
   references.

   To select the fields that EndNote should compare when finding duplicate references, click in the checkboxes
   to the left of the field names.

   The Generic names of the fields are used here. For details about which Generic field name corresponds to
   which specific field name for each reference type, see List of Reference Types. You may select as many
   fields as you want to make the duplicate detection more or less stringent.

Criteria Panel

   You may also set the Criteria to have EndNote compare the fields and look for an exact match or be more
   lenient in the comparison by ignoring spacing and punctuation.


Find Full Text Preferences
   This panel allows you control over which sites, services, and technology EndNote uses when attempting to
   find the full text for a reference. You can limit the options in order to speed up the Find Full Text operation.

   To access these settings, go to the Edit menu, select Preferences, and then click Find Full Text in the list of
   preferences.

   The checkboxes determine which pieces of information will be used from your EndNote references. These
   represent unique identifiers for locating exact reference matches.

   If your institution allows access to an OpenURL server, you can configure this panel to allow EndNote
   access to the site. Select the OpenURL checkbox and enter the OpenURL path to direct to the online site. If
   the site requires authentication to verify that you are allowed access, you can enter an Authentication URL.
   The Authentication URL directs EndNote to the site’s login page. When you attempt to Find Full Text, you
   will be directed to that page to enter authentication information (typically a user ID and password). If you are
   unsure of your institution's OpenURL settings, consult your local library Web page or a librarian at your
   insitution.

   To learn more about using the Find Full Text feature and about adding access to your institution’s library, see
   Finding Full Text for a Reference.


Folder Locations Preferences
   The Folder Locations preferences panel is where you set the personal folder locations for new or modified
   styles, import filters, and connection files.

   To access these settings, go to the Edit menu, select Preferences, and then click Folder Locations in the list
   of preferences.

   The many styles, filters, and connection files provided with EndNote are installed in the Styles, Filters, and
   Connections folders, which are located in the EndNote program folder.

       C:\Program Files (x86)\EndNote 2025\Styles
       C:\Program Files (x86)\EndNote 2025\Filters
       C:\Program Files (x86)\EndNote 2025\Connections

       Page 549 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


  When you display a list of styles, filters, or connection files in EndNote, the list is compiled from two
  locations: the installation folders listed above and your personal folders.

  The default personal folder locations for your modified styles, filters, and connection files are—

      C:\Users\[User Folder]\Documents\EndNote\Styles
      C:\Users\[User Folder]\Documents\EndNote\Filters
      C:\Users\[User Folder]\Documents\EndNote\Connections

   Note: To change the default installation folder for the provided styles, filters, or connection files, see
   Changing the Default Content File Location.

  Initially, your personal folders do not exist; they are created once you create a new file or save changes to
  an existing file. For example, when you open an existing style and make changes, you cannot Save, but
  must select Save As. You can give the file the same name or a modified name, but the file is saved to your
  personal Styles folder. The next time you view a list of output styles, you will see your modified style on the
  list. If you gave the file a different name than the original file, both are listed. If you gave the file the same
  name as the original, you will see the modified style listed, and not the original file, although it still resides in
  the program folder.

  Why do we bother with personal folders? Why not change or add to the installation folders? We
  implemented personal folders so that:

      ▪ If you reinstall EndNote for some reason, you will not overwrite a modified file with the same name.
         (We know you may have spent hours getting your file just right, and do not want to risk losing your
         work.)

      ▪ When you upgrade to a newer version of EndNote, you will not delete a new or modified file.

      ▪ When you download EndNote program updates, you will not overwrite a modified file.

      ▪ You can write protect a shared program folder, yet still use your own customized styles, filters, and
         connection files.

      ▪ You must have administrative rights to modify files in the Program Files (x86) folder. For many users,
         this is not an option, or not easily done.

  To change your personal folder locations:

     1. From the Edit menu, select Preferences.

     2. Click on Folder Locations.

     3. To change a folder location, click the Select Folder button for the Style Folder, Filter Folder, or
        Connections Folder.

     4. Locate the folder that you would like to designate as the new Style, Filter, or Connection folder, and
        then click the Select button.


Formatting Preferences
  The Formatting preferences panel allows you to control the formatting of bibliography entries in a word
  processor and whether EndNote automatically omits duplicate references from a bibliography.



      Page 550 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   To access these settings, go to the Edit menu, select Preferences, and then select Formatting from the list
   of preferences.

Suggest Formatting with EndNote’s Cite While You Write if the Document Type Is
Supported

   While the Format Paper feature for RTF files can be used on most word processor files, we recommend that
   you always use Cite While You Write for Microsoft Word or the most current versions of Apache OpenOffice
   or Libre Office (32-bit). It is much easier and allows more control, and for Microsoft Word provides more
   options to give you the exact output you want.

   When this item is selected, and you attempt to use Format Paper on a document that could be formatted
   with Cite While You Write, a message will appear recommending that you use Cite While You Write. You can
   still save the document to RTF and use Format Paper if you wish.

Omit Author and/or Year from Formatted Citation if Removed from Temporary Citation

   EndNote’s default behavior is to remove the author or year from the formatted citation if you remove either
   of those items from a temporary (unformatted) citation. For example, "{, 1999 #24}" would format as just
   "(1999)" when using a style that creates (Author, Year) citations. If you prefer to type just the record number
   into your papers as the temporary citation, you should turn this preference off so EndNote will not remove
   the author and year from all of your formatted citations.

    Note: Using just the record number in the paper will cause difficulties if you are working with more than
    one library, working with the same library on multiple computers with EndNote Sync, or working with your
    library and a library shared with you through EndNote Sync. This is because the same record number
    may appear in each library for different references. See Record Numbers and Components of a
    Temporary Citation for more information.


Merge Duplicates in Bibliography

   When you select this option, EndNote automatically omits duplicate references from a bibliography. Use this
   option if you are citing references from multiple EndNote libraries in one paper. In this situation, the same
   article reference might appear in two libraries and would have two different record numbers. EndNote will
   not identify the records as duplicates unless you have this option set to merge duplicates.

   When you select this option, EndNote checks the bibliography for duplicate references during the formatting
   process. If duplicates are found, they are removed. References are considered duplicates if they are the
   same reference type (such as Journal Article or Book) and the following fields are identical: Author, Year,
   Title, Secondary Title (Journal, Newspaper, Magazine, Book Title, Series Title, Conference Name, and so
   on), Volume, Issue, and Pages.

    Note: The Duplicates Preferences settings do not apply to this feature. The criteria for determining
    duplicates is separate and fixed for the Merge Duplicates in Bibliography setting.


Libraries Preferences
   To access these settings, go to the Edit menu, select Preferences, and then click Libraries in the list of
   preferences.

Choosing a Library to Open

   Use the Libraries preferences section to specify which libraries should open by default when you start
   EndNote. First, use the drop-down list to choose from these options:

       ▪ Open the most recently used library

       ▪ Open the specified libraries

       ▪ Prompt to select a library

       ▪ Do nothing
   If you opt to Open the specified libraries, you must list those specified libraries here. To add a library to the
   list:

      1. If the library is not already open, close the preferences dialog and open the library. Do this by
         selecting Open from the File menu, and then selecting the desired library.

          You can have more than one library open in EndNote, and you can set EndNote to open more than
          one library automatically when the program starts. Just open all the libraries you want to open
          automatically, then select the Open the specified libraries option.

      2. Return to the Libraries section of the Preferences dialog, and click Add Open Libraries to add all
         open libraries to the list.

   To remove a library from this list, select it in the Libraries panel, and then click Remove Library.

   Of course, once EndNote is started, you can always open a library by selecting Open from the File menu.


PDF Handling Preferences
   PDF Handling preferences allow you to define the automatic renaming process of PDF documents that you
   want to import to an EndNote library. These settings only apply to the renaming of PDF documents that
   have relative attachment links, and so are stored in the library's .Data folder. (See Selecting a Relative Path
   or an Absolute Path for File Attachments.)

   To access these settings, go to the Edit menu, select Preferences, and then select PDF Handling from the
   list of preferences.

   The renaming and auto-import processes work in the background when you open an EndNote library and
   while you are working in a library.

Auto Renaming Options

   Select an auto-renaming option.

       Don't Rename: This is the default option. EndNote does not rename PDF documents when they are
       imported into a library.

       Author + Year + Title: EndNote uses these fields as the first, second, and third fields in the PDF
       filename. A filename is created from the available data in the selected fields.

       Author + Title: EndNote uses these fields as the first and second fields in the PDF filename. A filename
       is created from the available data in the selected fields.

       Page 552 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       Author + Year: EndNote uses these fields as the first and second fields in the PDF filename. A filename
       is created from the available data in the selected fields.

       Title: EndNote uses only the Title field in the PDF filename. A filename is created from the available
       data in the selected field.

       Custom: You can select up to three fields to base the name on, as described below.

Custom Option

   The Custom option allows you to create a personalized method of renaming PDF documents.

   A Rename Options dialog opens when you select this radio button. The dialog lets you choose up to three
   fields (or None) in the PDF filename. For example, you could select:

       ▪ Author, Year, Title (default setting)
          or

       ▪ Title, Author, Year
          or

       ▪ Title, Year
          or

       ▪ You can select any combination of fields from the menu. However, you cannot select the following
          fields.

           ▪ Figure

           ▪ File Attachments

           ▪ Last Updated

           ▪ Rating

           ▪ Read Status

    Note: Look at the text box below the Custom radio button after you have made your selections from the
    dialog to ensure that you selected the needed fields.


PDF Auto Import Folder

   Select the Enable automatic importing checkbox to enable automatic importing of your PDFs.

   Select the folder from where you want EndNote to import PDFs into your library automatically. Download or
   copy your PDF files to this folder for automatic importing and renaming. EndNote imports all PDFs in your
   PDF Auto Import Folder and stores them in a temporary group called Imported References. This group will
   not appear the next time you open EndNote, but the references will still be in your library. If you wish to put
   the references in a custom group, you should do so before closing EndNote, while they still appear in
   Imported References.




       Page 553 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   After EndNote runs the import operation, EndNote creates a subfolder called Import within the Auto Import
   Folder. During the import, EndNote creates a copy of the PDF in the .Data folder of the library, and
   then moves the original PDF to this subfolder after importing. To save disk space, you may want to
   occasionally clean out this subfolder.

   Keep in mind that EndNote does not import PDFs from subfolders within the PDF Auto Import Folder.

File Renaming Conventions

       ▪ Files names — 50 character maximum count, including the period (.) and filename extension.

       ▪ 15 character maximum count per field.

       ▪ Year Field — 4 character limit.

       ▪ A hyphen (-) is used to separate fields

       ▪ An underscore (_) is used for any characters that cannot be represented in a file name.
          EndNote replaces the following characters with an underscore (_) during the renaming process.

           ▪ Quotation Mark (")

           ▪ Asterisk (*)

           ▪ Slash Mark (/)

           ▪ Colon (:)

           ▪ Left Angle Bracket (<)

           ▪ Right Angle Bracket (>)

           ▪ Question Mark (?)

           ▪ Backslash (\)

           ▪ Vertical Bar (|)

File Naming Rules

       ▪ You can rename attached PDF documents at any time by selecting a reference containing a PDF
          attachment, and then selecting from the References menu, File Attachments > Rename PDFs. All
          the PDFs attached to that reference will be renamed according to the rules. See Renaming
          Attachments and PDF Files.

       ▪ If a PDF file name exceeds the 50 character limit, then EndNote truncates the file name during the
          renaming process.

       ▪ Unicode characters are accepted during the renaming process.

       ▪ If you select Author-Year-Title renaming, and the PDF document does not have a year, EndNote
          inserts a hyphen (-) between the author name and the title to replace the missing year data.




       Page 554 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


Import File and Import Folder Options

   EndNote renames all PDF documents that you import via the Import File and Import Folders commands
   based on your current renaming preferences.

   For example, if you define renaming as Author+Title, then EndNote renames the PDF by author name and
   title and ignores the date of the published work.

   This rule also applies to Custom preference settings.


Read/Unread Preferences
   Use these settings to apply Read or Unread status tags to your references in order to track your research.

   To access these settings, go to the Edit menu, select Preferences, and then click Read/Unread in the list of
   preferences.

Read/Unread Options

   The options are Mark a References as Read Upon—

       ▪ Viewing it in the Reference, PDF, or Preview within the Library window.
          By default, EndNote changes the status of a reference from Unread to Read after you view a
          reference in the Reference Edit or Preview panels, or open the PDF for viewing in a separate PDF
          window (see The PDF Viewer).

          If you clear the checkbox, the status of an Unread reference remains the same after you view a
          reference in the Reference Edit or Preview panels, or in a separate window.

       ▪ Changing its rating.
          If you select this checkbox, EndNote changes the status of a reference from Unread to Read after
          you change the Rating of the reference from the Reference List.

          If you clear the checkbox, the status of an Unread reference remains the same after you change the
          Rating of the reference.

Library Window Option

   Clear the Show unread references in bold text checkbox to view all your references in normal text. The
   default value shows all unread references in bold text.

Read/Unread Features

       ▪ All new references are marked as Unread by default.

       ▪ Each reference has either a Read or an Unread status. If the Read/Unread field is shown in the
          Reference List, clicking the Unread button changes the status to Read. Clicking the Read button
          changes the status to Unread.

       ▪ If the Read/Unread field is not shown in the Reference List, you can change the status by right-
          clicking on a reference, or set of references, and selecting the new status from the drop-down list.



       Page 555 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       ▪ EndNote automatically saves the status of a reference whenever you change the status from Read
          to Unread or vice-versa.

       ▪ A reference changes to an Read status if you edit a field in the Reference Edit panel.

       ▪ In the Reference List, by default the text of a reference with an Unread status appears in bold. The
          text of a reference with a Read status appears in normal font. This can be changed using the Library
          Window option as described above.


Reference Types Preferences
   Use the Reference Types preferences panel to customize your settings for the fields (such as Author, Year,
   and Title) and reference types (such as Journal Article or Book) that are used by EndNote. Any changes that
   you make in this panel apply to all of the libraries that open on the computer for your user account.

   To access these settings, go to the Edit menu, select Preferences, and then click Reference Types in the list
   of preferences.

    Note: Be very, very careful about using the Apply to All Ref Types option. If you make a change to a
    reference type, such as editing a custom field, then apply that change to all reference types, you are likely
    to overwrite necessary fields in other reference types. It is best to customize each reference type
    individually.


Default Reference Type

   When you create a new reference in your EndNote library (by selecting New from the References menu),
   the new reference is set up for a journal article by default. If you would rather have new references
   automatically appear as books, patents, or some other reference type, change the Default Reference
   Type setting:

       ▪ Click the Default Reference Type list and choose from one of the available reference types.
   If you need a reference type that is not in the list, you will need to create a reference type for it and define it
   yourself (see Customizing Reference Types).

Defining Reference Types

   If you need to modify any of EndNote’s fields or reference types, click the Modify Reference Types button.
   This opens the EndNote Reference Types preference where you can add, delete, and rename EndNote’s
   reference types and fields.

   See Customizing Reference Types for more information about reference types and how to customize them.

Reference Type Table

   You can use the Export and Import buttons to share a customized reference type table with another
   EndNote user. See Backing Up or Sharing Your Reference Types Table for step-by-step instructions.

    Note: Replacing another user's RefTypeTable.xml file overwrites all changes to his/her current Reference
    Types table.

Sorting Preferences
    When EndNote sorts author names and titles, you can identify which words or names to ignore for sorting
    purposes.

    To access these settings, go to the Edit menu, select Preferences, and then click Sorting in the list of
    preferences.

        ▪ To add a word to be ignored by sorting, enter the term in the text box below either the Author Field or
           the Title Field and click Add.

        ▪ To remove a word from either list, select the term and click Remove.
    Click EndNote Defaults to revert both lists to the default settings.

Author Field

    The Author Field list is designed so that you may enter parts of author names that may be omitted for
    sorting purposes. For example, prepositions in names such as "von," "van," and "de" can be included as
    part of the last name, but not considered part of the name for sorting purposes. The entries in the Author
    Field list are case sensitive; that is, if you enter "von" it applies only to "von" and not "Von."

    These settings apply to the Generic fields for Author, Secondary Author, Tertiary Author, Subsidiary Author,
    and Translated Author. No names are entered by default.

Title Field

    When terms are added to the Title Field list, the sorting routine ignores them when they appear at the start
    of the title. Capitalization does not matter for these words. That is, the word "the" can be entered
    (lowercase) and still apply to "The."

    These settings apply to the Generic fields for Title, Secondary Title (includes the Journal field), Tertiary Title,
    Short Title, and Alternate Title. The words "a," "an," and "the" are entered as defaults.

     Note: When you close the Preference panel and return to your library list, you must manually sort your
     references to build a new sort that uses your revised list.


Where is this information saved?

    The lists of terms entered into the Sorting preferences panel are stored in the C:\Users\[Your Folder]
    \AppData\Roaming\EndNote\ENSort.txt file. To duplicate the lists for another computer running EndNote,
    copy this file to the same location on the other computer. For another user account on the same machine,
    copy the file to the other user’s matching EndNote folder.

    See also Sorting the Library and Special Cases in Sorting.


Spell Check Preferences
    On the Spell Check preferences panel, you can set general spell check options and select or modify
    Dictionaries. For general information about how to start spell checking a record, see Checking Spelling.

    To access these settings, go to the Edit menu, select Preferences, and then select Spell Check in the list of
    preferences.

        Page 557 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


    Note: If you are unable to add dictionaries, or to add words to or edit dictionaries, it is probably because
    your Windows security settings are preventing you from making changes in the \\Program Files (x86)
    folder. The best option is to copy the C:\Program Files (x86)\EndNote 2025\Spell folder and all its
    contents to another location, then load the dictionary files from that location. This should allow you to
    make changes to the files or create your own dictionary files.


General Options

   You can access these Spell Check Options from the EndNote Preferences Spell Check panel or from the
   dialog that appears when you run Spell Check.

      1. Click the Options button.

      2. Select the checkbox next to each item you want to apply during spell checking.

      3. Select a Main Dictionary language from the list of available dictionaries.

      4. For each language, EndNote uses a combination of dictionary files located in EndNote’s Spell folder.
         Select your primary language. If you want to apply additional language dictionaries, see Adding an
         Existing Dictionary below.

      5. Decide how fast and accurate you want spell checking to work. We suggest setting the option to at
         least Moderately fast and accurate.

      6. Click OK to save the changes.

Modifying Dictionaries

   You can access the Dictionaries preferences from the EndNote Preferences Spell Check panel or from the
   dialog that appears when you run Spell Check.

      1. Click the Dictionaries button.

      2. Use this dialog to view or edit the content of existing dictionaries, to add existing dictionaries for use,
         to create new dictionaries, and to remove dictionaries. The dictionaries listed under Files are
         currently in use (in addition to the Main Dictionary selected under Options).

      3. To modify dictionaries:

      4. Under Files, select the dictionary file you want to view or modify.

      5. If it is already in the list, select it.

      6. If you need to locate an existing file to use, use the Add File button to locate the file on your
         computer and add it to the list. By default, dictionaries are kept in EndNote’s Spell folder.

      7. To create a new dictionary, click New File.

      8. To remove a dictionary, display the file name in the list and click Remove File. This removes a
         dictionary from use, but does not delete the actual disk file.

      9. The words in the selected dictionary appear in the top list.

     10. To add a word to the selected dictionary, type it under Words and click Add Word.

     11. To delete a word from the selected dictionary, select the word and click Delete Word.

     12. To change the Action applied to a word, select the word and then pick the new Action from the list.

Adding an Existing Dictionary

   You may have selected English (or a different language) as your Main Dictionary Language, but want to
   apply an additional language during spell checking.

      1. On the Dictionaries dialog, click the Add File button.

      2. In EndNote’s Spell folder, locate the dictionary file you want to use and Open it. The dictionary is
         added to the list under Files.

Importing/Exporting a Dictionary

   The Dictionaries dialog includes Import and Export buttons.

   Use Import to locate and import a plain text file of terms into the current dictionary. The text file should
   contain a list of terms, with each term on its own line. If you are typing the list into a text file, make sure each
   term is followed by a carriage return, including the last term in the list. If you are creating the list in a word
   processor, make sure to use Save As to save the file as plain text. If your terms contain extended
   characters, save with the Unicode (UTF-8) encoding option.

   Use Export to save all terms from a dictionary to a plain text file, where each term starts on a new line.

Dictionaries Supplied with EndNote

   These dictionaries are supplied with EndNote. When you select the main dictionary language, a combination
   of files are loaded, including files not listed here.

   When you want to add additional languages, find the Dictionary you want to use from the left column, then
   look for the corresponding File Name. When you Add a dictionary, look for the appropriate File Name in
   EndNote’s Spell folder.

Spell Check Dictionaries Dialog

   The Dictionaries Dialog allows you to open and close user dictionaries, and to edit the contents of an open
   user dictionary. The contents of dictionaries are saved in disk files. You can open some or all of your user
   dictionary files at any time. Only open dictionaries are checked during a spell-checking operation.

    Note: If you are unable to add dictionaries, or to add words to or edit dictionaries, it is probably because
    your Windows security settings are preventing you from making changes in the \\Program Files (x86)
    folder. The best option is to copy the C:\Program Files (x86)\EndNote 2025\Spell folder and all its
    contents to another location, then load the dictionary files from that location. This should allow you to
    make changes to the files or create your own dictionary files.


       ▪ Action list: Used to select an action which is associated with words in the dictionary. The action tells
          the spelling checker what to do when it finds a word in the dictionary. The following actions can be
          selected:

           ▪ Auto change (use case of other word): This action allows you to automatically replace one
              word with another, always with the same case pattern as the other word. This action is useful for
              automatically expanding abbreviations. For example, you could select the word "TBD" in the
              Words list, or type it in the Words text field, then type "to be determined" in the Other word field,
              and select Auto change (use case of other word) as the action. The spelling checker will
              automatically replace "TBD" with "to be determined."




       Page 560 of 631
Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


    ▪ Auto change (use case of checked word): This action allows you to automatically replace one
       word with another. For example, if you often type "recieve" instead of "receive" you might select
       the word "recieve" in the Words list, or type it in the Words text field, and then type "receive" in
       the Other word field, and select Auto change (use case of checked word) as the action. The
       spelling checker will automatically correct "recieve" wherever it appears. If "recieve" was
       capitalized ("Recieve") the spelling checker would automatically replace it with "Receive." Note
       that the replacement is made automatically only if the Auto Change option is enabled (see the
       Options Dialog for information on the Auto Change option).

    ▪ Conditionally change (use case of other word): This action allows you to optionally replace
       one word with another, always with the same case pattern as shown in the Other word field. This
       action is useful for optionally expanding abbreviations. For example, you could select the word
       "TBD" in the Words list, or type it in the Words text field, and then type "to be determined" in the
       Other word field, and set Conditionally change (use case of other word) as the action. The
       spelling checker will ask if you want to replace " TBD" with "to be determined."

    ▪ Conditionally change (use case of checked word): This action allows you to optionally
       replace one word with another. For example, if you often type "recieve" instead of "receive" you
       might select the word "recieve" in the Words list, or type it in the Words text field, and then type
       "receive" in the Other word field, and select Conditionally change (use case of checked word) as
       the Action. The spelling checker will ask if you want to replace "recieve" with "receive." If you
       chose to replace it, and "recieve" was capitalized ("Recieve") the spelling checker would replace
       it with "Receive."

    ▪ Ignore (skip): This action tells the spelling checker that the word is spelled correctly, and so can
       be skipped over. This is the most common action.

    ▪ Exclude (treat as misspelled): This action tells the spelling checker that the word is misspelled,
       even if it is listed in another dictionary. Words marked with this action will never be offered as
       suggestions for misspelled words, and they will be reported as misspellings when they are
       encountered by the spelling checker. Note that the spelling checker looks up words in user
       dictionaries in the order in which they appear in the Files list. If you want to exclude a word,
       make sure it doesn't appear in a previous user dictionary.

▪ Add File button: Opens a user dictionary file. When you select the Add File button, a dialog appears
  which you can use to select the dictionary file to open. The set of open dictionary files is
  remembered, so once you add a dictionary file you do not need to add it again. If you need to create
  a new user dictionary, use the New button. You can open other applications' user dictionary files, if
  they use a compatible file type. See Dictionaries Supplied with EndNote for a list of dictionaries
  supplied with EndNote.

▪ Add Word button: Causes the word selected in the Words list to be added to the currently selected
  dictionary. The currently selected Action and Other word are associated with the word. You can use
  the Add Word button to change the action or other word associated with a word. Note that the Add
  Word button is enabled only when a new word is typed in the Words text field. The words you add
  may contain virtually any character, but only words which contain embedded periods should have
  trailing periods (for example, "U.S.A." is OK, but "USA." is not).

▪ Close button: Closes the Dictionaries dialog.

▪ Delete Word button: Causes the word appearing in the Words text field to be removed from the
  currently selected dictionary. The associated action and other word are also removed.

▪ Export button: Saves the contents of the currently selected dictionary to a text file. When you select
  the Export button, a dialog appears which you can use to select the name of the text file to which
  words in the dictionary will be exported. The words are written to the file one per line.


Page 561 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       ▪ Files list: Contains the list of open dictionary files. When you select a file from the list, its contents
          are displayed in the Words list.

       ▪ Import button: Adds the words contained within a text file to the currently selected dictionary. When
          you select the Import button, a dialog appears which you can use to select the text file to be
          imported. Each word in the selected file is loaded into the dictionary.

       ▪ Language: Displays the language (for example, English or French) of the words in the currently
          selected dictionary.

       ▪ New File button: Creates a new user dictionary file. When you select the New button, a dialog
          appears which you can use to specify attributes of the new dictionary. See the New Dictionary Dialog
          dialog for details.

       ▪ Other Word text box: Contains an alternate word associated with the currently selected word. The
          other word is used in the Auto change and Conditionally change actions to supply a replacement
          word. You can enter more than one word in the Other word box, but the total length should be limited
          to 63 characters.

       ▪ Remove File button: Closes the currently selected dictionary file. Closed dictionaries are not
          checked during a spelling check. Although the file is closed, it is not deleted. Closed dictionary files
          can be later reopened using the Add File button.

       ▪ Words list: Contains the list of words in the currently selected user dictionary.

Spell Check Options Dialog

   You can use the Options Dialog to specify various spelling-checker options. These options affect the way
   the spelling checker operates.

       ▪ Ignore capitalized words: When enabled, any words beginning with a capital letter are ignored
          (they are skipped over without being checked). You might enable this option if the text being checked
          contains many proper names.

       ▪ Ignore all-caps words: When enabled, any words containing all capital letters are ignored (they are
          skipped without being checked). You might enable this option if the text being checked contains
          many acronyms.

       ▪ Ignore words with numbers: When enabled, any words containing embedded digits are ignored
          (they are skipped without being checked). Examples of such words include "Win2000" and "Q4." You
          might enable this option if the text being checked contains many code-words or other symbols
          containing digits.

       ▪ Ignore words with mixed case: When enabled, any words containing an unusual mixture of upper-
          and lower-case letters are ignored (they are skipped without being checked). Examples of such
          words include "MicroHouse" and "CapsLock." You might enable this option if the text being checked
          contains many variable names or other symbols which use case changes to distinguish words.

       ▪ Ignore domain names: When enabled, text strings that end with a domain extension, such as
          ".com," ".org," or ".edu" are ignored (they are skipped over without being checked).

       ▪ Report doubled words: When enabled, any word appearing twice in a row is reported via the
          Check-Spelling Dialog.




       Page 562 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      ▪ Case sensitive: When enabled, a distinction is made between capitalized and noncapitalized words.
         For example, "canada" is considered different from "Canada," so "canada" would be reported as a
         misspelling. When the option is disabled, "canada" and "Canada" are considered identical. Note that
         the performance of the spelling checker will be reduced if this option is disabled.

      ▪ Phonetic suggestions: When enabled, suggestions are made on the basis of phonetic (sounds-like)
         similarity to the misspelled word. This option tends to improve suggestions for badly misspelled
         words. Enabling this option will increase the time required to locate suggestions. Note that either this
         option or the Typographical Suggestions option must be enabled or no suggestions will be offered.

      ▪ Typographical suggestions: When enabled, suggestions are made on the basis of typographical
         (looks-like) similarity to the misspelled word. This option is appropriate for people who are generally
         good spellers. Note that either this option or the Phonetic Suggestions option must be enabled or no
         suggestions will be offered.

      ▪ Suggest split words: When enabled, two separate words will be suggested as a replacement for a
         misspelling containing two joined words. For example, "is the" would be suggested as a replacement
         for "isthe" in a record.

      ▪ Auto correct: When enabled, words marked with Auto Change actions will automatically be
         changed to their specified replacements. When disabled, you will be prompted before the words are
         changed.

      ▪ Main Dictionary language: Select the primary language. This affects which dictionaries are loaded
         for spell checking.

      ▪ Suggestions: Determines the speed and accuracy of the initial search for suggested replacements
         for misspelled words. When a misspelled word is detected, a search is automatically made for
         suggestions. This option controls the speed and accuracy of this automatic search. Pressing the
         Suggest button in the Check-Spelling dialog causes an increasingly more accurate (but slower)
         search for suggestions. Options include:

          ▪ Fast but less accurate: Fast, but misspelled words may be missed.

          ▪ Moderately fast and accurate: Less fast, but more likely to find misspelled words.

          ▪ Slow but accurate: Slower, but with the best chance of finding misspelled words.

      ▪ OK: Closes the Options Dialog, and saves any changes made to the option settings.

      ▪ Cancel: Closes the Options Dialog, and discards any changes made to the option settings.

Sync Preferences
  To access these settings, go to the Edit menu, select Preferences, and then click Sync in the list of
  preferences.

  This dialog saves subscription credentials and sync settings to automate the process of synchronizing your
  EndNote library with your EndNote Web/Online library.

  Sync Preferences allow you to set your preferences so that:

   Once you create your EndNote Web/online account, EndNote 2025 populates the fields on the Sync
   Preferences page with the e-mail address and password that you entered during registration. Later you can
   change the data in these fields if you ever change your e-mail address or password.

    Note: We recommend that you create a compressed library backup the first time that you initiate the Sync
    process. See Saving a Compressed Copy of a Library for more information.

   See The Sync Feature for information on how to initiate the Sync process from the Library.

EndNote Web/Online Account Credentials Panel

   Once you register and activate your EndNote Web/online account, you can edit the fields in the EndNote
   Account Credentials panel.

       ▪ Enter your e-mail address. EndNote uses your e-mail address to verify your identification.

       ▪ Enter your EndNote Web/online password.
   EndNote uses these credentials to access your EndNote Web/online library. Once you save this information,
   you will not have to enter it again. EndNote saves the information until the next time you access Sync
   Preferences and decide to make changes.

    Note: If you need to change the e-mail address or password for your EndNote Web/online account, sign
    in to your account using your browser and select the Options tab to access the Password and E-mail
    Address options. These cannot be changed in EndNote desktop. After changing them online, update the
    credentials in EndNote 2025 to match.


Sync This EndNote Library Panel

   This field contains the name of the EndNote desktop library that you have synchronized with your EndNote
   Web/online library. You cannot edit this field.

   If this field is blank when you first access Sync Preferences, EndNote will populate the field with the path
   and file name of the currently opened EndNote library after you run Sync.

    Notes: You can always change the name of the library in this field by opening another library from the
    EndNote window. Click the Sync Now button in the Sync Status window to complete the process. The two
    libraries will be merged and the name of the opened library will appear in this field. See Merging Libraries
    through Sync.

    This field is not active until you register and create an EndNote Web/online account.


Sync Automatically Check Box

   The Sync process works automatically in the background (every 15 minutes) when you select this checkbox.

   When you close EndNote, the system prompts you to Sync your EndNote desktop library with your EndNote
   Web/online library.

EndNote Defaults and Revert Panels

Temporary Citations Preferences
   To access these settings, go to the Edit menu, select Preferences, and then click Temporary Citations in the
   list of preferences.

   A "temporary citation" is an unformatted citation that EndNote inserts into your word processing document
   when you use the Insert Citation(s) command from Word, OpenOffice, or LibreOffice, or when you copy and
   paste a citation into a document. You can also type temporary citations into your document. The temporary
   citation is a placeholder that EndNote later changes to a formatted citation, such as (Smith Jones, 2015).

   By default a temporary citation includes the first author’s last name, the year, and the EndNote record
   number, enclosed in curly braces:

       {Smith, 2015 #24}

   If necessary, you can change the temporary citation delimiters, and can set a field other than Record
   Number, to be used in temporary citations in this preference panel.

Temporary Citation Delimiters

   Curly braces are the delimiters used by default to indicate the start and end of each temporary citation. If
   you commonly use curly braces in your writing, you might want to select a different pair of markers for
   EndNote to use as Temporary Citation Delimiters.

   Enter the desired markers into the appropriate boxes at the top of the Temporary Citations preferences
   panel.

    Note: Be sure to use characters that are not likely to appear in the text of your document. For example,
    do not use left and right parentheses characters because these are frequently used in writing, and any
    text in them would be considered a temporary citation by EndNote.


Record Number Marker

   The number sign (#) always precedes the record number in an EndNote temporary citation. You may
   change this by entering another character in the Record Number Marker box.

   The EndNote record number is a unique number assigned to each reference as it is added to a library. The
   number is specific to that reference in that particular library. If you are using the same library on multiple
   computers through EndNote Sync, or collaborating with other writers who are sharing their libraries through
   EndNote Sync, you might find it easier to replace the Record Number in the temporary citation with
   something that uniquely identifies the reference but is not specific to a single EndNote library on a single
   computer. To do so, select the Use field instead of record number option and select from the Label field, the
   Accession Number field, or the Pages field.

       ▪ The Label field can be used to manually enter any unique code that you would like to use for each
          record.

       ▪ The Accession Number field is designed to contain the unique record number assigned to a
          reference from an online database.

       ▪ The Pages field can contain a unique page number or another unique number for each record.




       Page 566 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


    Notes: If you have selected the Label, Accession Number, or Pages field, and that field is empty in a
    particular reference, the Record Number will appear in the temporary citation.

    EndNote record numbers are unique to a library but are not permanent identifiers. They can change
    through syncing, copying a reference from one library to another, or even cutting the reference from a
    library and pasting it back into the same library. See Record Numbers for more information.


Citation Prefix Marker

   The Citation Prefix Marker separates prefix text in a citation from the citation itself. For example, if you
   wanted a citation formatted as:

       (see also Smith, 2015)

   you would enter the text into the temporary citation as follows, with the "\" indicating the end of the prefix text
   and the start of the citation:

       {see also \Smith, 2015 #24}

   If you prefer to use a different character as the Citation Prefix Delimiter, you may enter it in this preferences
   panel. Semicolons (;), letters, numbers, and characters already used as other delimiters may not be used for
   the Citation Prefix Delimiter.

    Note: When you use Cite While You Write’s Edit & Manage Citation(s) command to add prefix text, the
    Citation Prefix Marker is automatically inserted as part of the temporary citation.


Including Notes in the List of References

   Some journal styles permit you to include notes with the list of works cited at the end of the document. In
   such a system, the notes are numbered just like the citations, and included in the reference list, just like the
   references. This feature is only available with numbered in-text citation styles.

   To identify text to be included as a numbered note in the reference list:

      1. Type the text into the body of your document where you would want the number for the note to
         appear (or use the Insert Note command in Word, see Including Notes in the List of References in
         Microsoft Word).

      2. Be sure to surround the entire section of text with your Temporary Citation Delimiters (curly braces
         by default), and begin it with "NOTE:". For example:

          {NOTE: The authors would like to acknowledge the support of...}

   When the paper is formatted by EndNote using a numbered style, the text is assigned a number and listed
   along with the references at the end of the paper.

   The way that these notes are identified may be changed in the Temporary Citations preferences. Enter a
   prefix that you would like to use to signal that the text should be treated as a note.

Restrictions on the Use of the "NOTE" Feature

       ▪ This feature requires that a numbered style be used for the formatting; otherwise, the note will be left
          as it was entered in the body of the text.


       Page 567 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       ▪ Enter text only. Do not attempt to insert graphics, equations, or symbols as note text.

       ▪ Do not use the temporary citation delimiters as part of the text of the note. Other markers, such as
          the record number marker and the prefix marker and the multiple citation separator may be used.

       ▪ These types of notes cannot be combined with regular temporary citations within the same set of
          brackets. They should be cited separately—each in its own set of brackets.


Term Lists Preferences
   To access these settings, go to the Edit menu, select Preferences, and click on Term Lists in the list of
   preferences.

   By default, every new EndNote library has three term lists associated with it: Authors, Journals, and
   Keywords. The term lists are automatically updated as you enter references into your library. The terms in
   these lists are also used to facilitate data entry using the Suggest Terms as You Type feature. This feature
   suggests terms as you type into fields with term lists linked to them. For example, as you type into the
   Author field, EndNote suggests author names from your Authors term list to help you with data entry. When
   you enter a new term that is not currently in the associated term list, it appears in red text to indicate that it is
   a new term. This can point out typing mistakes or the use of an incorrect keyword if you thought you were
   entering a name or a term commonly used in your library.

   Any of the term list settings described above can be turned off using the settings for the Term Lists
   preferences.

Suggest Terms as You Type (Auto-Completion)

   When selected, EndNote will automatically complete matching terms when you are typing into a field that is
   linked to a term list (see Inserting Terms into References).

   If you turn this feature off, you may still insert terms into a field by opening the desired term list from the
   Library > Open Term List menu and double-clicking the desired term, or by pressing Ctrl+1 to open the term
   list associated with the field you are working in.

    Note: When using auto-completion with Author fields, enter the author's last name first, followed by a
    comma, to get the quickest match.


Update Lists When Importing or Pasting References

   When this option is selected, the term lists are automatically updated as you import references (using the
   Import command from the File menu), Direct Export, drag-and-drop references, or paste references in to
   your library. If you turn this option off, you can always manually update your term lists by selecting Define
   Term Lists… from the Library menu, highlighting a term list, and clicking Update List (see Manually Updating
   Term Lists).

Update Lists During Data Entry

   When this option is selected, the term lists are automatically updated as you type in new reference data. If
   you turn this option off, you can always manually update your term lists by selecting Define Term Lists…
   from the Library menu, highlighting a term list, and clicking Update List (see Manually Updating Term Lists).

URLs & Links Preferences
   To access these settings, go to the Edit menu, select Preferences, and click on URLs & Links in the list of
   preferences.

Connection Log File

   When you use the Online Search command to connect to an online database, EndNote keeps a copy of all
   of the retrieved references for that session in the connection log file (the file name is "Connect.log"). This
   happens by default, but you may turn this option off by clearing the Use Log File option.

   We recommend keeping the option turned on because in the event that the references were not correctly
   retrieved or filtered into EndNote, you can always adjust the filter in the connection file, and import the
   Connect.log file instead of redoing the search and download (see Importing a Log File).

   By default, the Connect.log file is stored in the folder: C:\Users\[User Name]\App Data\Roaming\EndNote

   You may change the name and the location of the Connect.log file by clicking the Choose button. In the
   dialog that appears, enter a new name for the file (if desired), and select the new location for the file.

ISI Base URL

   When you export references from the Web of Science Core Collection to EndNote, EndNote creates a Go to
   ISI link in the URL field of each reference. These links take you back to the source record where you can
   find related references, times cited, and other information. If you have upgraded from an earlier version of
   EndNote, you may need to click EndNote Defaults to update the ISI Base URL to the latest setting

OpenURL Arguments

   The URL > OpenURL Link command on the References menu starts your default web browser and displays
   the full text article (if available) plus a list of links to similar articles. It connects to an OpenURL standard
   syntax server and uses these OpenURL preferences along with data in your EndNote record to find related
   online references.

    Note: This command has no relation to the URL field found in EndNote references or the URL > Open
    Link command on the References menu (which opens the specific URL found in the URL field).

   We include a default argument to search for related online records. You can use this argument as a syntax
   example if you wish to enter your own arguments here.

    Note: We suggest checking with your institutional library before changing these settings, as different
    institutions may have custom settings. Remember, you can revert back to the EndNote defaults at any
    time by clicking EndNote Defaults.


Attached Files

   When you attach files to EndNote references, you have two options available to you. You can:

       ▪ Insert the file as a relative link.
          In this case, EndNote makes a copy of the original file and places it in the .Data\PDF folder that is
          part of your EndNote library. EndNote will always be able to access the file, even when you share


       Page 569 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


         your library with a colleague. However, if you edit the original file on your computer, those changes
         will not be reflected in EndNote. You would need to make changes in your EndNote library's copy,
         or clear the file from your EndNote reference and reinsert the file.

      ▪ Insert the file with an absolute path.
         In this case, EndNote will always look in the original folder for the inserted file. This allows you to
         easily access the file from outside of EndNote. However, if you ever move the file from the original
         folder, EndNote will not be able to access it unless you clear the file from your EndNote reference
         and reinsert it from the new folder location. If you send your library to a colleague, share the library
         through EndNote Sync, or use EndNote Sync to access your library on multiple computers, the file
         will not be available.

  By default, the checkbox titled Copy new file attachments to the default file attachment folder and create a
  relative link is selected, so that EndNote will copy linked files to the .Data\PDF folder. You can deselect this
  box in order to save absolute paths. You can always override this default setting on the file dialog when you
  are inserting a file.

  Find Full Text always saves files to the default attachment folder and creates relative links.

  See Selecting a Relative Path or an Absolute Path for File Attachments for more information on relative
  versus absolute links.


Cite While You Write Preferences for Microsoft Word
  You can access the Cite While You Write preferences in two ways:

      ▪ In Word, select Preferences from the EndNote 2025 tab.

      ▪ In EndNote, select Cite While You Write [CWYW] > CWYW Preferences from the Tools menu.

   Note: Your word processor must be open in order to access CWYW Preferences from the Tools menu in
   EndNote.

General Preferences in Microsoft Word
  General preferences are useful when you always use your EndNote library along with your word processor
  and you always use your word processor along with your EndNote library.



      Page 570 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


  To access General preferences, select Preferences on the EndNote 2025 tab in Word.

      ▪ Open EndNote When Starting Word: Select this item to always open EndNote when you start
         Microsoft Word.

      ▪ Close EndNote When Leaving Word: Select this item to always close EndNote when you leave
         Microsoft Word. This works only when the EndNote program was launched with one of the Cite
         While You Write commands from within Word or if the Open EndNote When Starting Word
         preference is selected.

      ▪ Return to Document After Inserting Citations: Select this item to always make your document the
         active window after inserting citations with EndNote’s Insert Selected Citation(s) command. If this
         preference is turned off so that the Word document remains in the background, you will not see the
         inserted citation in the Word document until the document becomes the active window. This is
         because the display for the Word document is not updated in the background.

      ▪ Enable Instant Formatting on new Word documents: This option is available for Cite While You
         Write. It turns Instant Formatting on or off for new Word documents. When you enable Instant
         Formatting, you can also determine how often EndNote scans for temporary citations and whether it
         checks for citation changes.

      ▪ To turn instant formatting on or off in an existing Word document, see Instant Formatting in Word.

      ▪ Turn off Word’s "Show field codes instead of their values option" when opening or updating
         documents that include citations: EndNote uses extensive Word field codes in order to identify
         and format citations. When field codes are displayed, your document can look confusing! See Field
         Codes in Microsoft Word for more information and an example.

         We recommend that you not view field codes in Word. This option ensures that you will see
         appropriate text in your document.


Keyboard Preferences in Microsoft Word
  Keyboard shortcuts for EndNote’s Cite While You Write commands are available in Word.

  To add or change a keyboard shortcut:

     1. In Word, select Preferences on the EndNote 2025 tab.

     2. Click the Keyboard tab.

     3. From the list of commands, select the command for which you would like to add (or change) a
        shortcut.

     4. Under Press new shortcut key, enter the new shortcut key combination on the keyboard.

         ▪ Keyboard shortcuts work in both EndNote and Microsoft Word.

         ▪ If you enter a key command that is already assigned to another Word or Cite While You
            Write command, EndNote will note which command it is currently assigned to.

     5. Click Assign to assign the new shortcut.

  Follow the same steps to remove an assigned shortcut key, except click Remove instead of Assign.

Figures and Tables Preferences in Microsoft Word
   Use settings in the output style to determine whether images are placed in-text or at the end of the
   document, where captions and labels are located, and separation and punctuation around images and
   captions. See Figures and Tables.

   The figures and tables settings in the EndNote preferences in Microsoft Word override settings from the
   current output style. If your output style is set to print figures and tables in a list at the end of the document,
   the settings on this tab are ignored. However, if your output style is set to print figures and tables in-text, you
   can use this tab to override settings when you have moved figures around in your document and want to
   retain their placement.

   To customize the in-text placement of EndNote figures and tables in Word.

      1. On the EndNote 2025 tab, select Preferences.

      2. Select the Figures and Tables tab.

      3. Select the appropriate radio button to:

           ▪ Place each figure or table directly after the paragraph where it is first referenced, or

           ▪ When regenerating figures, keep each figure or table in its current position. This allows you to
              move images around in your document and have them stay there when you Update Citations and
              Bibliography again.


Application Preferences in Microsoft Word
   Use the Application tab in the Word Cite While You Write preferences to indicate which version of EndNote
   to use when you use Cite While You Write.

       ▪ EndNote 2025 is your desktop version of the EndNote application.

       ▪ EndNote is the online version of EndNote.
   To select the appropriate application:

      1. On the EndNote or EndNote 2025 tab in Word, select Preferences.

      2. Click the Application tab.

      3. Select the appropriate application: EndNote (desktop) or EndNote online.

   The system adds an EndNote 2025 tab to Word's Tabs when you select the EndNote menu option; the
   system adds an EndNote tab when you select the EndNote online menu option.

    Note: Even though selecting EndNote online will show the EndNote tab, to actually use the EndNote
    online option, you must have created an EndNote online account.

Showing Word Processor Codes
   The formatted citations and bibliography in your document are not plain text; they contain hidden data that
   make it possible for EndNote to unformat and reformat citations and bibliographies.

Microsoft Word’s Field Shading

   Formatted citations and bibliographies in Word documents are Microsoft Word fields. This gives EndNote
   the ability to uniquely identify them.

   When you click on a field in Word (such as a formatted EndNote citation or the bibliography), it becomes
   shaded. You can change this behavior so that the fields are always shaded, shaded only when selected, or
   never shaded. To do so:

      1. In Word, select Options from the File menu.

      2. Click the Advanced button and scroll down to the Show Document Content section.

      3. From the drop-down Field shading menu, select your preferred option. These include:

          ▪ Never: This option will always show field codes as though they were plain text, with no shading.

          ▪ Always: This option will always shade field codes, making it easy to see them. This can be very
             helpful when troubleshooting a document because corrupted EndNote citations cannot be
             unformatted. If you think you have corrupted citations in your paper, make a copy of the
             document (never do this to the original), then in the copy unformat the citations and set the Field
             Codes preference to always show shading. When you scan through your document, you will
             easily spot any EndNote citations that did not unformat, indicating corruption of the code. You can
             then go back to the original document to delete those citations and reinsert them from EndNote.

          ▪ When Selected: This is the default setting. It will show shading only when you click on (select) a
             field code, such as an EndNote citation.

           Note: Field shading never prints; it only shows on the screen to help you locate field codes in your
           document. The Word settings of the person viewing the document control the shading, not the
           document creator. If you send your document to someone and they complain about the shading,
           they will need to adjust their Word options. You can send them these instructions to help them with
           that.

      4. Click OK to close the preferences window and save your changes.

    Note: If you are seeing detailed field code information, see Field Codes in Word and General Preferences
    for Microsoft Word for information on showing and hiding field codes.


Related EndNote Preferences

       ▪ CWYW Keyboard Commands for Word

       ▪ Contextual (Shortcut) Menus

       ▪ The Library Toolbar
   To add or change Cite While You Write keyboard shortcuts in Microsoft Word, see Keyboard Preferences in
   Microsoft Word.


Contextual (Shortcut) Menus
   As a convenience, EndNote provides contextual (shortcut) menus for some of the most commonly used
   features. Contextual menus appear when you right-click on something in the EndNote program (such as a
   reference, a group name, or an Author field).

   The contents of the menu depend on where you click and what options are available for that particular item.
   Only a subset of possible commands are displayed. These are intended to represent the most commonly




       Page 574 of 631
    Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


used functions for the selected target. Choosing a command from a contextual menu has exactly the same
result as choosing the command from the main menu or the toolbar.

A contextual menu appears wherever you click. It remains open until you choose a command from the list,
click elsewhere, or press the Escape key.

Contextual menus are available in at least the following areas: the Reference window, the Reference List,
the Groups panel, term lists, and Managers (styles, filters, and connections).

A Typical Installation
   A typical installation of EndNote will install all the essential components of the software, with a limited
   number of the most popular styles, filters, and connection files (called "content files" as a group). EndNote
   has thousands of content files, so many that installing all of them can impair program performance. Installing
   only the most popular content files as a default still allows you to add files at need, while improving
   performance. See the following for information on installing additional content files.

       ▪ Installing Additional Output Styles

       ▪ Installing Additional Connection Files

       ▪ Installing Additional Filters

       ▪ Custom Installations/Adding Content Files

A Typical Installation for a Single-User License of EndNote

   copy of the installer in a safe location, in case you want to install EndNote again or on another computer. A
   single-user copy of EndNote can be installed on up to three computers, but they must all have the same
   user.


A Typical Installation for an Institutional License of EndNote
   If your institution has provided you with a site license installer for EndNote, you will need two files: the
   EN2025Inst.msi installation file and a file called License.dat. These may have been provided in a zipped file.
   Both files are necessary to install EndNote 2025 without a product key or the need for buying a personal
   product license.

   To install EndNote 2025:

      1. If your institution has provided you with a zipped file containing the EN2025Inst.msi file and the
         License.dat file, you will first need to extract the files. You cannot install the program from the zipped
         file. Although Windows will let you see both files inside the zipped file, trying to install from within the
         zipped file will ask for a product key. Installing from the extracted files will not ask for a product key.

          Right-click on the zipped file and select Extract All from the menu.

      2. If asked at any time during the installation if you want to allow the application to make changes, click
         Yes. (No would cancel the installation.)

      3. Place both the EN2025Inst.msi and the License.dat files on your desktop or in a folder on your hard
         drive. Both files must be together in the same folder.

      4. Double-click on the EN2025Inst.msi file to begin the installation, then click Next.

      5. Read through the EndNote 2025 Volume License Version agreement. Click Accept to accept the
         agreement and continue the installation, or click Cancel to cancel the installation.

      6. The Read Me Information dialog will give you updated information on the program. Click Next when
         you have finished viewing it.

      7. The License Agreement dialog allows you to view the full license agreement for use of the product.
         To continue the installation, accept the license agreement and click Next.

      8. In the Select Installation Type dialog, leave the Typical radio button marked, then click Next. (If you
         wish to do a custom installation, choose that option here. See Custom Installations/Adding Content
         Files.)

      9. Click the Next button until the installation completes, then click the Finish button.

  You have now completed the installation of EndNote and can begin using the program. Be sure to save a
  copy of both the EN2025Inst.msi and the License.dat files in a safe location. They may be needed when you
  install updates or upgrades.


Custom Installations/Adding Content Files
  Although we recommend that you use the Typical installation option to install EndNote, the Custom
  installation option can be useful if you are low on disk space, if you need to reinstall only certain EndNote
  components, of if you would like to add additional content files (output stylestyles, import filters, and/or
  connection files).

  To perform a new custom installation:

     1. Follow the instructions for installing EndNote found in A Typical Installation until you reach the Select
        Installation Type dialog.

     2. On the Select Installation Type dialog, select Custom.

     3. When you get to the Select Features dialog, read the section below on Selecting Features to
        determine which features you would like to select or deselect for your installation.

  To install components after EndNote is already installed:

     1. Log in to the machine with administrative rights or as a user with program installation privileges.

     2. Do one of these:

         ▪ Start the EndNote installation program as you would for a new installation.

         ▪ From the Windows Start menu, select Settings, and then Apps. Scroll down, click on the EndNote
            application, and select Modify.

     1. On the Application Maintenance dialog, select Modify and then click Next.

     2. When you get to the Select Features dialog, read the section below called Selecting Features to
        determine what you would like to select/deselect for installation.


Selecting Features
  There are several major categories of components that can be installed with the product. The components
  you can select for installation include:

      ▪ EndNote Application

          ▪ EndNote Program

          ▪ Sample Files

          ▪ EndNote Help

          ▪ Getting Started Guide

      ▪ Cite While You Write for Microsoft Office


      Page 579 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      ▪ Extension for OpenOffice and LibreOffice

      ▪ Additional Connections
         Install or remove files for directly retrieving references from online reference databases. These are
         grouped by information service provider.

      ▪ Additional Filters
         Install or remove files for importing text files of reference data. These are grouped by information
         service provider.

      ▪ Additional Styles
         Install or remove output styles for formatting bibliographies and citations. These are grouped by
         category, e.g., Medicine, Humanities, etc.

      ▪ Spelling Dictionaries
         These are dictionaries available for the spelling checker.

  Click the plus sign next to each category to display a detailed list of items. For each category or
  subcategory, click the drop-down indicator (a small arrow) next to the name to select from the available
  installation options. To install a feature, select one of these:

      ▪ Will be installed on local hard drive.
         This will install the selected files.

      ▪ Entire feature will be installed on local hard drive.
         When used with the major styles, filters, or connection files options, this will install all the files for that
         content type, instead of having to select each file individually.


Updating EndNote Files
  EndNote automatically checks for program updates when you open the application.

  However, you can manually update EndNote when program enhancements are available.

  To update your copy of the EndNote program, select Check for Updates… from the EndNote Help menu to
  launch a wizard. The wizard checks for an update, lets you know whether an update is available, and then
  downloads the file(s) and applies the update to your EndNote installation. If no updates are available, you
  will receive a message to that effect.

   Note: You also have the option to download the latest files from the EndNote downloads page. We
   continually update output styles, filters, and connection files.



Uninstalling EndNote
  To uninstall EndNote:

     1. Log in to the machine with administrative rights or as a user with program installation privileges.

      Page 580 of 631

      ▪ Custom Style, Filters, or Connection Files
         C:\Users\User Name\Documents\EndNote

      ▪ Personal Reference Type Table, Connection Log, Libraries Shared with You, Saved Searches,
         and Miscellaneous Files

         C:\Users\User Name\App Data\Roaming\EndNote

      ▪ Registry Settings
         Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\ISI ResearchSoft

   Notes: The Windows App Data folder is hidden by default. To show hidden files in Windows, open File
   Explorer, select View > Options > View and mark the radio button option to Show hidden files, folders,
   and drives.

   Errors made in editing the registry can have serious consequences. If you are not experienced with
   working in the registry, we suggest you leave the registry settings as they are.



Installed Files
  The full EndNote installation includes the following default folders and files.


Program Folder (C:\Program Files (x86)\EndNote 2025)
  If you are running a 32-bit version of Windows, the folder will be C:\Program Files\EndNote 2025.

      ▪ EndNote.exe is the EndNote application file.

      ▪ EndNote.chm is the EndNote help file. You can double-click the file to view it. In the EndNote
         program, press the F1 key on your keyboard to open the help file or select EndNote 2025 Help from
         the Help menu.

      ▪ EndNote.pdf is a compilation of the Help topics in the online Help system. This is an editable PDF
         with a full table of contents via the bookmarks, allowing you to add your own comments.


      Page 581 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       ▪ Readme.txt contains late-breaking news.

       ▪ License Agreement.txt contains a copy of the current EndNote license agreement.

       ▪ The Examples shortcut folder provides a quick link to the example files in the C:\Users\Public\Public
          Documents\EndNote folder.

       ▪ The styles folder contains bibliographic styles for formatting citations and a bibliography. A typical
          installation includes only the most popular styles. With a Custom installation, you can choose from a
          full collection of over 7,500 bibliographic styles. See Installing Additional Output Styles.

       ▪ The Connections folder contains connection files to connect to and search online bibliographic
          databases. A typical installation includes only the most popular files. With a Custom installation, you
          can choose from a collection of thousands. See Installing Additional Connection Files.

       ▪ The filters folder contains import filters for importing text files downloaded from online bibliographic
          databases or data exported from other bibliographic software programs. A typical installation
          includes only the most popular filters. With a Custom installation, you can choose from a collection of
          hundreds. See Installing Additional Filters.

       ▪ The Terms Lists folder contains journal abbreviation term lists. These lists contain thousands of
          journal names and standard abbreviations. Import a list into your library’s Journals term list to use
          the abbreviations in your bibliographies.

       ▪ The Spell folder contains spell check dictionaries for the EndNote spell checker.

       ▪ Various additional folders and files are installed to support the EndNote program and to integrate
          EndNote with other software programs.


Personal Folder
   Open the Documents folder in File Explorer to find the EndNote folder located at C:\Users\User
   Name\Documents\EndNote. These folders are created when you create or modify a file:

       ▪ The Styles folder contains new or modified bibliographic styles.

       ▪ The Connections folder contains new or modified connection files.

       ▪ The Filters folder contains new or modified import filters.
   While the program folder contains the default styles, connection files, and filters, your personal EndNote
   folder contains those files that you have created or modified. This prevents changes to the original files, and
   assures that you will not inadvertently delete a customized file when you remove or upgrade the EndNote
   program. It also allows you to make changes to files even though you may not have administrator access to
   modify files in the Program Files folder. EndNote displays a single list of the files found in both locations. If a
   file of the same name appears in both locations, EndNote will display only the file found in your personal
   folder.

   You can change your personal folder locations. See Folder Locations Preferences for more information.


Preferences Folder
   Depending on your settings, this folder may be hidden from view in File Explorer.

   Windows 10 or 11: C:\Users\User Name\App Data\Roaming\EndNote

       Page 582 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   While many EndNote preferences are stored in the Windows registry, some are stored in your personal
   preferences folder. It contains the connect.log file that records your latest online search, the
   RefTypeTable.xml file which stores your reference type preferences, saved search strategies, libraries
   shared with you, and various other settings. See Being Invited to a Shared Library and About Shared
   Libraries.

    Note: The Windows App Data folder is hidden by default. To show hidden files in Windows, open File
    Explorer, select View > Options > View and mark the radio button option to Show hidden files, folders,
    and drives.



Installing Additional Output Styles
   The EndNote team has developed over 7,500 different output stylestyles. Because installing all of these
   styles can slow performance, a typical EndNote installation includes only the most popular styles. You can
   install sets of styles by discipline with the EndNote installer or you can download individual styles from the
   EndNote site.


Using the EndNote Installer to Install Additional Output Styles
   First, make sure EndNote is closed and not running; Microsoft Word and Microsoft Outlook should also be
   closed. You can run the EndNote installation program again, select the option to Modify the installation, and
   then select sets of output styles to install.

   You can also use the Windows Apps & Features setting to add new styles.

   To install sets of output styles:

      1. Log in to the machine with administrative rights or as a user with program installation privileges.

      2. From the Windows Start menu, select Settings and then Apps. This should default to the Apps &
         Features setting.

      3. In Apps & Features, scroll down to the EndNote application and select it.

      4. Click the Modify button. The EndNote Application Maintenance window should appear, with Modify
         selected.

      5. With Modify selected, click the Next button.

      6. In the Select Features window, expand the Additional Styles list.

      7. Open the drop-down menu for the set of styles you want to add and select Will be installed on local

   The styles will now be available in EndNote to select for formatting.


Installing Additional Connection Files
   The EndNote team has developed thousands of different connection files. Because installing all of these
   files may slow performance, a typical EndNote installation includes only the most popular connection files.
   You can install sets of connection files by provider with the EndNote installer , or you can download
   individual connection files from the EndNote desktop web site.


Using the EndNote Installer to Install Additional Connection Files

EndNote on Networks
Using Libraries on a Network
   The volume edition of EndNote is licensed for a particular number of users; you can install EndNote locally
   for each of the licensed users. Users can access a common library on a server or their own personal library.
   See Networks and Volume Installations (Licensing of Volume Copies).


Multi-Platform Networks
   EndNote libraries (databases) are directly compatible across Windows and macOS platforms and do not
   require any special conversion procedures (see Transferring Libraries between Computers or Platforms).
   Because of this, EndNote can be used in a mixed platform network environment very easily.


Multi-User Library Access
   Even though EndNote can be used across a network, it was not designed with specific networking
   capabilities in mind. EndNote does not perform record locking functions that would allow multiple users to
   edit one library at the same time. However, multiple users can access one EndNote library simultaneously
   as long as the library is restricted to read-only status. This will allow the user to perform searches, copy
   information to their documents, and format their papers. Use File Explorer to change the Properties of your
   EndNote library; select the Read-Only attribute for the .enl file and the .Data folder.

   The simplest way to set up an EndNote library for shared network access is to use the network’s system of
   file permissions to control the type of access allowed for users and groups. One or two people should be
   assigned the responsibility for maintaining and updating the library; these users should be granted full
   access to the library .enl file and .Data folder. All other users should be granted read-only access. See
   Multiple People Opening One Library.


Special Issues in Network Environments
   EndNote does not perform record locking, but it does require file locking. Some Windows network client
   programs (for example, NFS clients used to connect to UNIX servers) do not fully support these protocols.
   File locking is an optional component in some implementations of NFS (LockD). In addition, some network
   file systems implement a compatibility mode that may prevent file locking from working properly. Network
   clients other than those provided by Microsoft should be tested to ensure that file locking is enabled.

   EndNote assumes a maximum file name length based on the capabilities of the operating system on which
   it is running; under Windows, errors may occur if EndNote attempts to store a long file name on a server that
   does not support long file names.

    Note: The environment in which EndNote will be used must support long file names.



Custom Settings
   EndNote allows you to customize many areas of the program to suit your needs. Most settings are saved for
   each user.


       Page 587 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


General Preferences
   Most general preferences are stored in the Windows Registry. This includes many EndNote Preferences,
   subject bibliography settings, and Cite While You Write settings.


Reference Types
   If you plan to share your libraries with other users, you may want to limit use of new and modified reference
   types.

       ▪ Changes made to the reference types table apply to all libraries opened on that computer from the
          current user account.

       ▪ If your library is opened from a different computer, your references will follow the layout of the
          reference types table for that computer and user.

   If you create a custom reference type or modify a reference type for records in your EndNote library, you
   should make sure the reference type is also created or modified on other computers that will access the
   library. See Backing Up or Sharing Your Reference Types Table.


Saved Searches
   Search strategy files are saved by default in your Searches folder:

   Windows 10: C:\ Users\User Name\ AppData\Roaming\EndNote\Searches

   Windows 11: C:\ Users\User Name\ AppData\Roaming\EndNote\Searches

   You may save them elsewhere if you prefer, but EndNote will open to this Searches folder when you choose
   to Load a saved search. EndNote search files use “.enq” as the file name extension.


Cite While You Write
   Cite While You Write codes are directly compatible between the versions of Word EndNote 2025 supports.
   See Program Requirements for information on the versions supported.

   Because reference data is kept with each formatted citation, you can collaborate with other authors on a
   paper without each author having the same library.


About Volume Installations
   The volume edition of EndNote is licensed for a particular number of users; you can install EndNote locally
   for each of the licensed users (see Networks and Volume Installations (Licensing of Volume Copies)). Users
   can access a common library on a server or their own personal libraries. See Using Libraries on a Network
   for limitations on sharing a library on a server.

   For volume installations, you must first unlock the installer as described in Unlocking the Volume/Site
   License Installer, and then distribute and install the program using one of the methods described in About
   Mass Program Installations.




       Page 588 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide



Before You Begin Network Installation
  For mass installation of the full program, see About Mass Program Installations.

  Please make sure that you meet these requirements before installing:

      ▪ Make sure EndNote is licensed for the appropriate number of users. See Networks and Volume
         Installations (Licensing of Volume Copies).

      ▪ Make sure the server supports long file names. EndNote 2025 includes many files with long file
         names. If the server (or volume) does not support long file names, EndNote 2025 cannot be used on
         it.

      ▪ Make sure file locking is enabled on the server. EndNote requires file locking. See Special Issues in
         Network Environments.


Networks and Volume Installations (Licensing of Volume
Copies)
  Clarivate expects that network administrators will take appropriate steps to maintain compliance with the
  software license. The license agreement (License Agreement.txt) can be found at \\Program Files
  (x86)\EndNote 2025\License Agreement.txt. You can purchase a single or multi-user license:

  Single User License

  A single EndNote product purchase is licensed to an individual, and is not to be shared.

  Volume/Site License

  There are three volume license options available. (Please contact sales for information on pricing for your
  group.)

      ▪ Multi-user perpetual license: Starting at 5 users, this is a perpetual one-time fee for the latest
         version without new releases.

      ▪ Subscription license: Starting at 5 users, this is a yearly subscription with a contract which includes
         future releases within the term of the contract.

      ▪ Sitewide license: A sitewide license can be customized to your organization. Please contact
         sales for information on pricing for your group.

  An EndNote volume/site license allows multiple users. EndNote can be installed on individual PCs using
  mass installation (up to the number of users indicated in the license agreement).

  If you have questions about the licensing of EndNote at your institution, consult your institution's software
  licensing department.

Unlocking the Volume/Site License Installer
Windows

Simple Method

   The Volume/Site license installer uses a single product key for multiple users. To automatically include the
   key for your licensed users, you must unlock the installer. This produces a new installer file, along with a
   validating License.dat file.

    Note: This information applies only to the Volume/Site license installer, and does not apply to any other
    EndNote licenses.

   To unlock the volume/site license installer:

      1. Download the .msi installer and the compressed ADMIN.zip file.

          Download EN2025.msi installer

          Download ADMIN.zip (you will need to scroll to the bottom of the page)

      2. Extract the ADMIN.zip file. The result will be an ADMIN folder with an ADMIN.BAT file in it.

      3. Place the ADMIN.BAT file and the .msi installation file together in the same folder (on the desktop
         works fine).

      4. Double-click the ADMIN.BAT file to run it.

      5. When prompted, enter the site's EndNote product key and mark the box saying I hereby
         acknowledge that I have read and accept all terms of the license agreement, then click Next.

      6. Click the Browse button and select a location for the new .msi installer and the .dat file. This must not
         be the same location as the original .msi installer.

          Do not select the option titled "Perform Administrative Installation."

      7. Click Next, and Next again.

   When the installation is complete, you will find an EN2025Inst.msi file and a License.dat file in the target
   folder. These files must both be present in the same folder to install the EndNote program. See About Mass
   Program Installations, A Typical Installation for an Institutional License of EndNote.

For Advanced Users

   For creating the unlocked site license installer, you need to run the installer in administrative mode.
    You can also do this by launching Command Prompt, and then running the following command:

       msiexec.exe /a EN20Inst.msi

macOS
    Because of macOS security requirements, users cannot create a site installer for EndNote. When you
    purchase a volume/site license, Clarivate will provide a site installer for your institution. If you have any
    questions, please contact your sales representative.

     Note: For updated information and instructions with screenshots, see the knowledge base article

About Mass Program Installations

Windows

    With the volume/site license version of EndNote, a network administrator can use mass installation to install
    EndNote on multiple Windows machines.

    Please make sure that you meet these requirements before installing:

        ▪ Make sure EndNote is licensed for the appropriate number of users. See Networks and Volume
           Installations (Licensing of Volume Copies).

        ▪ Make sure that each computer is running one of the following Windows operating systems.

            ▪ Windows 10

            ▪ Windows 11
    In Administrative Mode, the EndNote installer will prompt for a volume product key, which generates a
    License.dat file. The License.dat file must accompany the installer for volume license distribution in order to
    later bypass the product key installation prompt. See Unlocking the Volume/Site License Installer.

Deployment Methods

    You can deploy the EndNote installer to multiple machines in one of these ways:

        ▪ Easy Deployment

        ▪ Deploying the EndNote Installer with Group Policy

        ▪ Scripted Program Installations
    You can use the provided MSI Command Line Options for guidance. If you need additional information, refer
    to Microsoft’s mass installation documentation and command line documentation.

Content File Installation

    Early versions of EndNote always installed all predefined content files (output styles, import filters, and
    connection files). These number in the thousands, and when they are all installed they can affect the speed
    and performance of EndNote. In EndNote , a typical installation includes only the most popular styles, filters,
    and connection files. If you do not know what subset of files are required by your users, you may want to

   install all files. You can do this by setting the property "INSTALLALLCONTENTFILES" to "yes." See
   Installing All Content Files.

macOS

   Because of macOS security requirements, users cannot create a site installer for EndNote. When you
   purchase a volume/site license, Clarivate will provide a site installer for your institution. If you have any
   questions, please contact your sales representative.

    Note: For updated information and instructions with screenshots, see the knowledge base article
    EndNote: Volume License Install Steps.


Easy Deployment
   With the volume/site license version of EndNote, a network administrator can use mass installation to install
   EndNote on multiple machines.

Recommended easy installation:

      1. First, unlock the installer to generate an EN2025Inst.msi file and a License.dat file. See Unlocking
         the Volume/Site License Installer.

      2. Deploy the EN2025Inst.msi and License.dat files together. You can deploy in any way you want, but
         make sure the two files are in the same directory when executed. You could zip the two files to
         distribute them to end users, you could create a Group Policy deployment where both files are
         delivered to the same location on the target machine, or you could drop the two files in a shared
         network location from which users execute the installer.

    Note: If the files are deployed in a zipped file, the user will need to extract the files before installing
    EndNote. The installation will not work correctly if run from a zipped file.


Using the volume installer to install on an individual computer:

      1. First, unlock the installer to generate an EN2025Inst.msi file and a License.dat file. See Unlocking
         the Volume/Site License Installer.

      2. Distribute both the EN2025Inst.msi and License.dat files to the user. For example, you can copy
         them to a shared network drive.

      3. The user should then copy the two files, EN2025Inst.msi and license.dat to the same folder on his/
         her individual computer.

      4. The user should log on to the computer with administrative rights, and then run EN2025Inst.msi to
         install the EndNote program. See A Typical Installation.


Deploying the EndNote Installer with Group Policy
   Before you begin:

        ▪ Make sure all workstations are using MSI 3.0 or later. If needed, you can download an update from
          Microsoft.


       Page 592 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


       ▪ Make sure the share that EndNote is being deployed from is published in Active Directory.

       ▪ Make sure the computer account has permission to access the share.

    Note: This software has not been tested with the Windows Distributed Filing System (DFS)


    Note: By default, only the most popular output styles, import filters, and connection files are installed with
    EndNote. This speeds up performance. However, if you want to install all of the available content files
    (thousands), you can create a new Transform and set the INSTALLCONTENTFILES property to "yes".
    See Installing All Content Files.


New Installations

   To deploy across an organization with Group Policy:

      1. First, unlock the installer to generate an EN2025Inst.msi file and a License.dat file. See Unlocking
         the Volume/Site License Installer.

      2. Open the Group Policy for the Domain or Organizational Unit (OU) you want to modify.

      3. Under Computer Configuration, expand Software Settings and click Software Installation.

      4. Right-click Software Installation and select New > Package.

      5. Browse for the share from which EN2025Inst.msi will be deployed. (Make sure the required
         license.dat file is in the same folder.)

      6. In the Deploy Software dialog, you may select either Assigned or Advanced if you wish to modify the
         advanced settings. See the appropriate Microsoft help file for help on configuring the advanced
         options.

          Once the Group Policy is updated and the clients are restarted, EndNote is installed upon boot.

      7. (Optional) For each user account, you can configure EndNote as the default citation manager in
         Word.

Upgrade Installations

   To upgrade your current installations:

      1. First, unlock the installer to generate an EN2025Inst.msi file and a License.dat file. See Unlocking
         the Volume/Site License Installer.

      2. Open the Group Policy for the Domain or Organizational Unit (OU) you want to modify.

      3. Under Computer Configuration, expand Software Settings and click Software Installation.

      4. Right-click Software Installation and select New > Package.

      5. Browse for the share from which EN2025Inst.msi will be deployed. (Make sure the required
         License.dat file is in the same folder.)

         Word.


Scripted Program Installations
   An EN2025Inst.msi file is available for download.

   To install via a command line:

      1. First, run the installer in Admin mode (/a on the command line).

      2. Install EN2025Inst.msi from the target directory. (Make sure the required License.dat file is in the
         same directory.)

   Use the provided MSI Command Line Options table for guidance. If you need additional information, refer to
   Microsoft’s mass installation documentation and command line documentation.

Changing the Default Content File Location
   Content files include output styles, filters, and connection files. These are typically installed in the EndNote
   program folder. For example

             C:\Program Files (x86)\EndNote 2025\Styles
             C:\Program Files (x86)\EndNote 2025\Filters
             C:\Program Files (x86)\EndNote 2025\Connections

   However, you may want to install the default content files in a folder other than the EndNote program folder.
   You may want to use a common, shared folder for all users in your organization.

    Note: Remember that EndNote compiles style, filter, and connection file lists from both the default
    installation folder and a user’s personal content folders. For information about setting a personal folder
    location, see Folder Locations Preferences.

   Below is a method that an administrator could use to run the installer and tell EndNote to relocate the "main"
   content file locations. If the Styles, Filters, and Connections folders are located at D:\Shared\Content\, then
   that path should be used for CFDIR.

Method 1: Specify a Custom Folder Path via Command Line

   This method will work for most users, who install EndNote by launching the installer. To install EndNote with
   a custom content file folder setting:




       Page 597 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   For EXE installations:

          EN2025Inst.exe CFDIR=”< path_to_content_folders>”

   For MSI installations:

          msiexec.exe /I EN2025Inst.msi CFDIR=”< path_to_content_folders>”

Method 2: Specify a Custom Folder Path via Transform

   This method is for site system administrators, who want the end user to install or deploy the application
   without the user changing settings.

   Update the value of the “CFDIR” property in the Property table, save the transform, and create the group
   policy object to deploy the installer with the transform. (See the transform documentation for the tool you are
   using, such as Orca).


Installing All Content Files
   Content files include output styles, filters, and connection files. Earlier releases of EndNote installed all
   available content files. The number of predefined content files is now in the thousands, and may adversely
   affect the speed and performance of EndNote. Your users, however, may prefer to have access to all files.

    Note: You can combine this command along with changing the default content file path. See Changing
    the Default Content File Location.


Method 1: Change the Setting via Command Line

   This method will work for most users, who install EndNote by launching the installer. To install all content
   files with EndNote:

   For EXE installations:

       EN2025Inst.exe INSTALLALLCONTENTFILES=yes

   For MSI installations:

       msiexec.exe /I EN2025Inst.msi INSTALLALLCONTENTFILES=yes

Method 2: Change the Setting via Transform

   This method is for site system administrators, who want the end user to install or deploy the application
   without the user changing settings.

   Change the value of the “INSTALLALLCONTENTFILES” property to "yes" in the Property table, save the
   transform, and create the group policy object to deploy the installer with the transform. (See the transform
   documentation for the tool you are using, such as Orca.)


Setting Local Find Full Text Preferences
   You can globally set the values for the Find Full Text panel under EndNote Preferences.

About Direct Export and Import Formats
   What do we mean by "direct export" and "import formats"?

   Direct Export: The information provider includes an option to save directly to EndNote. When you select
   this option, EndNote automatically looks for the appropriate filter in your EndNote Filters folder. You direct
   the references to the appropriate EndNote library. How well the information transfers depends on how
   accurately the information provider has tagged each item of bibliographic information.

    Note: UTF-8 (Unicode) is the default character encoding for text, XML, and HTML export from the
    product. RTF uses ASCII encoding for ASCII characters and "code page escapes" to encode characters
    beyond ASCII.

   Importing: When an information provider does not provide direct export to EndNote, the process of
   importing references becomes a little more complicated. You must save references from the information
   provider to a text file in a tagged format. Then, in EndNote, you must use the File > Import feature to select
   the tagged text file for import, choose the appropriate import filter, and then start the import process.
   See Importing Text Files for more information.

   You also have another option for copying references into your EndNote libraries. See How to Search an
   Online Database for information about directly searching and downloading from various online databases.

                            Copyright Issues and Fair Use of Downloaded Data

           EndNote gives you the capability to import references downloaded from online
           databases into its libraries. Some producers of online reference databases expressly
           prohibit such use and storage of their data, others charge an extra fee for a license to
           use the data in this way. Before you download references from a database, be sure to
           carefully check the copyright and fair use notices for the database. Note that different
           databases may have varying restrictions, even from the same information provider.


Direct Export Providers
   Many information providers have websites that include a direct export option, allowing you to send copies of
   references directly to an EndNote library. The direct export process automatically selects an EndNote import
   filter to map bibliographic information into the appropriate EndNote fields. All you need to do is select the
   EndNote library into which the data should be imported.

   Start by opening the EndNote library into which the data should be imported. This "direct export" or "direct
   download" method does away with the additional steps of saving the references to a text file, and then
   importing that file with the appropriate import filter.

   in some cases, you may be required to select an appropriate filter. When the direct export process is
   started, EndNote first checks the file for tags that are specific to a common import type, such as the
   EndNote desktop, Web of Science Core Collection, or RIS format. If no match is found, EndNote searches
   through all filters for a vendor ID and database ID that match the file. If no match is found, you are prompted




       Page 600 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   to select a filter. You can also check our Web site at https://endnote.com/downloads/filters/ for
   updated import filters.

   Contact your data provider if you have questions about whether their database supports direct
   export. Clarivate makes information on how to set up databases to work with direct export publicly available,
   so database providers can set their databases to work with direct export without our involvement. This
   means we cannot keep track of all the providers supporting this feature.

    Note: Because of the way some browsers handle MIME types, they may try to save your references to a
    file on your desktop. You may need to use Mozilla Firefox to access the Web site and export references
    into EndNote. This application allows you to specify how to handle data when you initiate a direct export,
    so you can select the EndNote application. See Enabling Direct Export for information on configuring
    Firefox and Google Chrome to send Direct Export files to EndNote.



Enabling Direct Export
   EndNote's Direct Export feature allows certain file types to be associated with the EndNote application.
   When a direct export file is sent from a browser to EndNote, EndNote can recognize the filter that should be
   used to import the references, and import them automatically.

   If you find that some Direct Export files that should be automatically sent to EndNote are not being sent, you
   may be able to make adjustments to how those file types are handled by the browser or operating system.

    Note: Changing settings to enable Direct Export will only work consistently with file types that were
    designed for Direct Export. Changing settings for other file types, such as plain text files, can cause
    problems and is strongly discouraged.


Setting Firefox to Open Direct Export Files in EndNote

   Firefox allows you to set the option to send files to EndNote within the program. The first time it downloads a
   file with a file type it does not recognize, it will show a window similar to the one below, asking what to do
   with the file. Choose the option to Open with ResearchSoft Direct Export Helper and mark the box to Do this
   automatically for files like this from now on. In the future, Firefox should send files of this type directly to
   EndNote. (The .nbib file type below is an example of the PubMed direct export format.)




       Page 601 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide




   If, in the past, Firefox was instructed to save this file type instead of sending it to EndNote, you can change
   that in the settings.

      1. In Firefox, navigate to Settings > General > Applications.

      2. Locate the Direct Export file type by the extension shown in the left column.

      3. In the right column for the extension, select Use other… and select ResearchSoft Direct Export
         Helper from the list.

      4. Close the Firefox settings to save your change.

Setting Chrome to Open Direct Export Files in EndNote

   Google Chrome allows you to set the option to send files to EndNote within the program when the file is
   downloaded. Click on the drop-down list arrow to the right of the file name. (This can be found in the bottom-
   left corner of the window.) Select the option to Always open files of this type, then select the ResearchSoft
   Direct Export Helper as the program to open the file with, if asked.




   The next time you use Google Chrome to download a file with that extension, it should automatically open in
   EndNote.

Windows 10/11 to Open Direct Export Files in EndNote

   Browsers other than Firefox, such as Chrome, may use the Windows settings for where to open file types. If
   the file does not automatically import into EndNote, you may be able to set Windows to recognize Direct
   Export file types and send them to EndNote.

      1. Navigate to Windows Setting by clicking Start > Settings.

      2. Select Apps from the list.

      3. Select Default Apps at the left, then Choose default apps by file type at the right.

      4. Scroll down the list on the left until you see the file extension you want to send to EndNote, then
         select ResearchSoft Direct Export Helper to the right.

    Note: These instructions worked at the time of this writing, but browsers and operating systems change
    over time. You may need to adapt these instructions to your present browser and operating system. Do
    not attempt to send files that are not appropriate for Direct Export, such as .txt files, to EndNote.


File Extensions Associated with Direct Export

   At the time of the EndNote 2025 release, these were the file type extensions EndNote will automatically
   associate with direct export:

       ▪ .CIW

       ▪ .ENW

       ▪ .RIS

       ▪ .NBIB

       ▪ .OVD

    Note: This list does not mean that only these file types will work with direct export, but that these files can
    be expected to work reliably with direct export.



APIs and Plug-ins
   The RSServices API is technology from Clarivate that provides a way to build on the power of EndNote. It
   exposes programmatic access to the core functionality of the EndNote application, allowing third parties to
   access database content and integrate EndNote with other tools. With the RSServices API users can create
   “plug-ins” that work within the EndNote interface to add customized functionality to EndNote and extend
   connectivity with other programs. Most of the RSServices API functions work with EndNote versions X and
   later.

   The basic functions of the API enable users to:

       ▪ Build plug-ins that add new functionality to EndNote.

       ▪ Provide better integration with third-party tools and products.


       Page 603 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      ▪ Create tools that extend the GUI of EndNote.

      ▪ Script or batch existing EndNote capabilities and features.

      ▪ Directly access records and data in EndNote Libraries (databases).

      ▪ Leverage the power of the EndNote formatting engine (Formatter).

      ▪ Directly Import or Export into or out of EndNote.
  The RSServices API is intended for technical audiences who have knowledge of object-oriented
  programming languages, particularly C and C++. Users should also be familiar with the tools needed to
  produce compiled application code or DLLs. The API is available for both the Macintosh and Windows
  operating systems and behaves identically on each, unless otherwise specified.

  Individual customers and third-party partners are encouraged to use the RSServices API to develop tools
  that closely interact with EndNote. Users are also encouraged to share their code and ideas with others on
  the EndNote User Forums at:

        https://community.endnote.com

  While individuals are welcome to use and share their work with others, any party developing a component or
  tool that uses the RSServices API for commercial or wide-spread use must also sign a license agreement
  with Clarivate to legally employ the API, RDK and any associated tools, documentation, or code.


The RSServices Development Kit (RDK)
  Supporting documentation and code samples are provided as part of the RSServices Development Kit
  (RDK), the RDK is available by request directly from the Clarivate EndNote team. The RDK is designed to
  work with several compilers and tools, including Apple's XCode and Microsoft's Visual Studio. In all cases,
  APIs are published in the C/C++ programming language, as are all samples and example code. It is
  assumed that the reader has a validly licensed copy of one or more of the aforementioned compilation
  products, as Clarivate does not supply or warrant such tools as part of the RDK. While it should be possible
  to port these interfaces to additional compilers or programming languages, readers should consult their
  license agreement or the Clarivate EndNote team before doing so.

  Contact the Clarivate EndNote team at http://endnote.com//support/contact-support for more information.


Backing Up Your EndNote Files
  We strongly recommend that you keep several backup copies of your critical computer files, especially your
  EndNote libraries and papers that you are writing. There are many ways that a file can be damaged: hard
  disks can fail, viruses can erase or corrupt files, and, of course, there is always human error and the
  possibility of accidentally throwing away your thesis or grant proposal the day before it is due. If you have
  any kind of disaster, big or little, backup copies can save you hours or days of work.

  The simplest way to make a backup is to use File Explorer to copy your files to a thumb drive or other
  portable storage device.

EndNote Sync as a Library Backup
  The Sync Feature provides a backup of your current library. If you accidentally delete your library files, you
  can sync your online library to a new empty desktop library and be working again in no time. EndNote can
  also recreate a damaged library on your desktop from the synced copy online. See Recovering a Damaged
  Library.

  However, if you have deleted references from your library and emptied the trash, they will also be deleted
  from the online copy of the library; if you have accidentally deleted references from the online library and
  emptied the trash, they would also be deleted from the desktop library at the next sync. Making a backup of
  your library at regular intervals ensures you have access to older material, if you ever need it.


Backup Suggestions
  Keep at least two sets of backup disks, each at a different location. We recommend that you have sets for
  alternate days, so if you discover that something went wrong yesterday, you will have the day-before-
  yesterday’s version.

  Make archival sets of all the files used when you finish an important document. An archival set should
  include all of the files that are needed to recreate a final formatted paper. Store the backups in a safe place
  far away from your computer (preferably off-site). If you ever need to recreate the document, you will have
  all of the necessary files.

  Your EndNote library may not be the only file you want to back up. If you have customized reference types,
  output styles, filters, or connection files, these should also be backed up. See Important Files to Backup for
  more information about this topic.

   Note: Although working EndNote libraries should not be kept in cloud folders or drives, a compressed
   library can safely be stored in the cloud because it is a single file. Be sure to move or copy the
   compressed library to your hard drive before opening it. See Saving a Compressed Copy of a Library.




Important Files to Back Up
  This topic lists the important EndNote files to backup. You may want to start by backing up the EndNote
  installer.

  The library files ([filename].enl and its matching .Data folder) are where all of your references are stored.
  Note that exporting data from your library is not a backup. An export file is just a text document, whereas an
  EndNote library is a database.

  If you saved your library as a package, the .enl file and .Data folder are part of the library package with the
  extension .enlp.


Saving and Restoring Compressed Libraries
  You can save an EndNote library (the [filename].enl file, its associated .Data folder, and all of its contents) to
  a single compressed file called [filename].enlx in order to back up your library or send a copy to a colleague.
  Later, you can restore the compressed library with EndNote. See below or see Saving a Compressed Copy
  of a Library.




      Page 605 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


Creating a Compressed Library File

      1. Open the library in EndNote.

      2. From the File menu, select Compress Library (.enlx) to display a Compressed Library dialog.

      3. Use the radio buttons to determine these options:

            ▪ Specify whether you want to Create a compressed library or to Create & Email the library.

            ▪ Specify whether you want to save file attachments with the library or not.

            ▪ Specify whether you want to save all references to the compressed library, only the selected
               (highlighted) references, or only the references in a specific group or group set.

            ▪ Click Next to display a file dialog.
      4. Save the compressed library (the default name is [original_file_name].enlx) to a folder on your hard
         drive. You can change the file name but you cannot use the following characters.

            Invalid Characters for Naming
                a Compressed Library
               \     back slash
               /     forward slash
               :     colon
              *      asterisk
              ?      question mark
              "      quotation mark
              <      less than
              >      greater than
               |     vertical bar

      5. If you selected the Create & Email option, EndNote will launch the Outlook application, create a new
         email, and attach the compressed library file to the email.

      6. Enter additional information to the email, such as a recipient, subject, and message. Click the Send
         button.

Restoring a Compressed Library File

      1. Use EndNote to open the filename.enlx file by selecting Open Library from the File menu, then
         selecting the .enlx file. This will extract the .enl file and the .Data folder to the same folder where the.
         enlx file is located.

      2. Use EndNote to open the [filename].enl file as you normally would to use the library.

    Note: EndNote libraries larger than 4 gigabytes or 65,535 files cannot be compressed with EndNote’s
    Compressed Library command. See Saving a Copy of a Library for information on making backup copies
    of larger libraries.

Custom Reference Types
   The current reference types table controls the reference types and fields available to all libraries opened
   under the current user account. It controls the reference types and fields available to styles, filters, and
   connection files, so it affects importing data and formatting documents.

   If you have customized your reference types, losing your reference types table will lose all your
   customizations.

Backup a Reference Types Table

      1. From the Edit menu, select Preferences.

      2. Click the Reference Types option in the list of preferences.

      3. Under Reference Type Table, click Export to display the Save As dialog.

      4. Name the file, select a folder where you will be able to find it later, and click Save. EndNote will
         append an .xml suffix to the file name.

   You now have a backup of your Reference Types Table.

Importing a Reference Types Table

    Note: When you import a Reference Type Table, you will overwrite the entire contents of your current
    Reference Type Table, losing any customizations you have made to your reference types. We suggest
    creating a backup of your current Reference Type Table before importing a new table, using the
    instructions above.

      1. From the Edit menu, select Preferences.

      2. Click the Reference Types option in the list of preferences.

      3. Under Reference Type Table, click Import to display a file dialog.

      4. In the file dialog, locate, highlight, and open the .xml file that was previously exported.


Modified Styles, Filters, and Connection Files
   Modified styles are important to backup so that you do not have to recreate the bibliographic format if
   something happens to your customized style. Similarly, custom filters and connection files should be backed
   up so that you do not have to redo the work to get your references to import as you want them.

   When you display a list of styles, filters, or connection files, the list is compiled from both the default
   installation folders as well as your personal folders.

   The default Styles, Connections, and Filters folders are installed in the EndNote program folder, and are
   typically found at—

      C:\Program Files (x86)\EndNote 2025\Styles
      C:\Program Files (x86)\EndNote 2025\Filters
      C:\Program Files (x86)\EndNote 2025\Connections



       Page 607 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


  If you have not modified these files, it is not important to make backups of them because you can always
  reinstall them with the EndNote Installer.

  Once you make a change to one of these files, or create a new file, it is saved to your personal Styles,
  Filters, or Connections folder. These folders are typically found at—

     C:\Users\[User Folder]\Documents\EndNote\Styles
     C:\Users\[User Folder]\Documents\EndNote\Filters
     C:\Users\[User Folder]\Documents\EndNote\Connections

  You can change the location of your personal folders with Folder preferences. To locate or change your
  personal Folder locations, see Folder Locations Preferences.


Word Processing Documents
  The papers you have written that include EndNote citations should be kept with your EndNote backup files.


EndNote Preferences
  If you have customized your sorting preferences, copy the following file:          C:\Users\[Your Folder]
  \AppData\Roaming\EndNote\ENSort.txt file.

  If you have customized your change case preferences, copy the following file: C:\Users\[Your Folder]
  \AppData\Roaming\EndNote\ENCase.txt file.



Menu Keyboard Commands
  The EndNote menus display equivalent key commands next to many menu commands, so you can execute
  commands without taking your hands off the keyboard to use a mouse. You can use the following tables as
  a quick reference.

  All commands are not always available to you. For example, if no references are highlighted in the Library
  window, the Edit References and Move References to Trash commands are not available from the
  References menu.

  These tables list only those commands with a keyboard equivalent. Not all menu commands have a
  corresponding keystroke.

  A few common issues are discussed below.


The EndNote Library is Corrupted
  If an EndNote library has been damaged, you may get an error message like the one below when trying to
  open it or work with the references. If you have been syncing the library with EndNote Web/online, click the
  Sync button and EndNote will attempt to repair your library from the copy saved online.




  If you have not synced the library, you may be able to use the Recover Library… command under the
  Library menu to repair the library.

  Any time you feel your library may be corrupted, even if you do not receive the message above:

     1. Back up the library. Do not replace any previous backup copies, just in case you need them!

      Page 612 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      2. From the Library menu, run the Recover Library operation to rebuild the library. See Recovering a
         Damaged Library for more information about this command.

   The two most frequent causes of library corruption are—

      1. Storing a library in a cloud-syncing folder or drive. Applications like Google Drive, iCloud,
         OneDrive, Box, Dropbox, etc. do a very good job of synchronizing individual files, but EndNote
         libraries are not just a single file. They are a combination of files working together. When you make
         changes in a record, you may affect more than one file, and those files must be updated in a set
         sequence. Synchronization applications do not always update the files in the correct sequence,
         which causes small errors that can eventually lead to corruption. So, do not store your working
         EndNote libraries in any syncing folder.

          A compressed library can be stored in a cloud-syncing folder or drive for archival purposes because
          it is a single file. However, it should be moved or copied to a nonsyncing location on your hard drive
          before opening it or using it.

      2. Storing a library on a network drive. Read-Write libraries should not be stored on network drives,
         to avoid corruption. If you need to share a library on a network drive, it should be a read-only copy of
         the library and the original library should be maintained on a computer hard drive. See Multiple
         People Opening One Library for information on using a read-only library on a network.


Cannot Save a Style, Filter, or Connection File on Windows
   You have edited a content file (a style, filter, or connection file), but when you try to save the file you cannot
   choose Save, but must choose Save As to save a copy.

   The styles, filters, and connection files provided with EndNote are installed in the Styles, Filters, and
   Connections folders, which are typically located in the EndNote program folder:

       C:\Program Files (x86)\EndNote2025\Styles
       C:\Program Files (x86)\EndNote2025\Filters
       C:\Program Files (x86)\EndNote2025\Connections

   However, when you create a new file, or modify one of the installed files, the file is saved in one of your
   personal folders. This aligns with Windows security measures to protect the contents of the program folders.
   By default, your personal folders are set to:

       Windows 10 and 11

       C:\ Users\User Name\ Documents\EndNote\Styles
       C:\ Users\User Name\ Documents\EndNote\Filters
       C:\ Users\User Name\ Documents\EndNote\Connections

   When you display a list of files in EndNote, the list is compiled from both folder locations: the installation
   folders found in the EndNote program folder, plus your personal folders. For more information about these
   folder locations, and how to change them, see Folder Locations Preferences.

   To make a modified file available to other EndNote users:

      1. Create the modified file and save it in your personal folder.

      2. Place a copy of the file in a shared location, or email it to your colleagues.




       Page 613 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      3. Have the colleague double-click on the file to open it in EndNote, then use the File > Save As
         command to save a copy of the file to their personal folder. The advantage of putting the file in a
         personal folder is that it will not be removed if EndNote is uninstalled or overwritten if a style of the
         same name is installed by EndNote.


Commands are Dimmed and Not Available
   Commands may be dimmed depending upon which part of the window is active. For example, if no text is
   selected in an Reference Edit panel, the Font options under the Edit menu would be dimmed because there
   would be no selected text to apply font changes to.


Opening EndNote 2025 Libraries in an Earlier Version of EndNote
   EndNote X9.3 introduced a new database engine. Libraries created in EndNote X9.3 or later are not
   backwardly compatible with older versions of EndNote. If you work in an environment with multiple versions
   of EndNote, you can convert your libraries to the new database engine using the instructions below.

Forward Compatibility to EndNote X9.3 and Later

   To use libraries created with EndNote X9.2 and earlier, convert the library by opening it in EndNote X9.3 or
   later. To do this, in EndNote X9.3 or later select File > Open Library, and then select the old EndNote library
   file you wish to convert. EndNote X9.3 or later will create a new library and leave the original library
   unchanged.

Backward Compatibility with Earlier EndNote Versions

   If you are not already syncing an EndNote library, using EndNote Sync would be the easiest way to access
   the library on a machine with an older version of EndNote. (If you are already syncing a library, syncing
   another library would merge the libraries. See Merging Libraries through Sync.)

   If you choose to sync the library, create a new empty library in the older version of EndNote, then enable
   EndNote Sync with that library open as the active library. See The Sync Feature for information on syncing a
   library for the first time. You would be able to use the library on both computers and have your changes sync
   back and forth between the versions.

    Note: When syncing libraries, record numbers will be different on the different computers. See Record
    Numbers for more information.


Exporting the Data for Import to an Older Version of EndNote

   EndNote X9.3 and later libraries are not backward compatible with previous versions. To use EndNote X9.3
   and later libraries with an older version of EndNote without using Sync:

      1. Export the EndNote X9.3 or later library to a XML file (.xml) by changing the File Type during
         export. See Exporting to EndNote XML for details.

      2. In the older version of EndNote, select Import > File from the File menu

      3. In the Import dialog, click Choose. Locate and select the filename.xml to be imported.

      4. Select EndNote Generated XML as the Import Option.



       Page 614 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      5. Set the Duplicates option to match your preferences.

          ▪ Import All: Imports all references, including duplicates.

          ▪ Discard Duplicates: Imports all references except duplicates.

          ▪ Import into Duplicates Library: Duplicate references are imported into a library called File-
             Dupl.enl, where ”File" is the name of the library into which you are importing.

           By default, a reference is considered a duplicate when the Author, Year, Title, and Reference Type
           match a reference already in the library. See Duplicates Preferences if you would like to change the
           duplicates criteria.

      6. Set the Text Translation to No Translation and then click on Import.

Compatibility Issues

   The older version of EndNote will not import any groups from the EndNote X9.3 or later version of the
   library.

   In order to have access to the file attachments the PDF subfolder of the EndNote X9.3 or later version of the
   library would need to be added to the new library created from the imported references.


Troubleshooting Connections
   When connecting with an online database, there are at least two computers involved in completing the tasks
   you wish to perform: yours and the database server. Most often, there are intermediary computers as well,
   such as Domain Name Servers ( DNS), proxy servers, and firewalls. With more than just your computer
   involved, things can get complicated.

   The most basic problem you can encounter with connections is the failure to connect at all. There are four
   ways you may experience this problem:

       ▪ EndNote cannot connect to the Internet (see Problems Connecting to the Internet)

       ▪ EndNote cannot find the host (see Problems Finding the Host)

       ▪ EndNote cannot connect to the host (see Problems Connecting)

       ▪ EndNote cannot communicate with the host (see Problems Communicating with the Host)

Problems Connecting to the Internet
   In general, if you are able to use a Web browser or other Internet software, you should also be able to
   connect with EndNote. Try using your Web browser to make sure your Internet connection is working.

Dial-up Connections

   Your computer system includes software to connect to the Internet through a modem connected to your
   telephone line. You need to set up the dial-up connections software in order to connect with your Internet
   provider.




       Page 615 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


   In most cases, trying to connect in EndNote will start up your dial up software automatically. Some
   networking packages require that you establish the dial-up connection manually before trying to connect in
   EndNote.


Problems Finding the Host
   There are a few possibilities for what could be wrong if EndNote cannot find the host server:

       ▪ The domain name specified in the connection file is wrong.

       ▪ There may be a problem with your network's Domain Name Server.
   If the connection file has worked in the past, the problem may lie with the Domain Name Server. If you have
   just made the connection file yourself and it’s never worked before, you probably entered the wrong Server
   Address.

   If you suspect problems with the Domain Name Server, contact your network administrator.


Problems Connecting
   Once the host is found, EndNote tries to connect. It sends a connection request to the host and waits for up
   to two minutes for a reply. It may receive none, or it may receive a refusal immediately. In the first case you
   will see a time-out error message, and in the second case you will see a "host refused connection" error
   message.

   If you wait for two minutes and receive a time-out message, the online computer is probably down for some
   reason. Try again later.

   If you receive a refusal message, and this happens no matter which connection file you try to use, you are
   most likely behind a firewall.

Firewalls

   Your system may be configured with a firewall to block certain ports. To connect to a database from behind a
   firewall, you must ask your network administrator to allow communication through the firewall for the port
   used by the online database you wish to search. You can open the connection file to find the appropriate
   server address and port number, as described below.

   Depending upon the configuration of the firewall, the administrator may allow communication to all
   computers outside the firewall on the requested port, or communication to a specific server and port.

Proxy Servers

   Your organization, or the online database provider, may use a proxy server to allow only valid users access
   to the organization’s network and/or database. Contact a network administrator from the organization to find
   out whether a proxy server is used.

   If you already have access to the remote network with your Web browser, check the configuration of your
   Web browser. Look for "proxies" or "proxy server." (See your Web Browser documentation to locate proxy
   server settings, as the location changes depending on which version you are using.) The configuration for a
   proxy server has two pieces of information: an address and a port.




       Page 616 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


    Note: EndNote will automatically handle the proxy server when accessing http-based connections
    (PubMed and Web of Science Core Collection) if the proxy server settings are configured through the
    operating system's Internet options.


Finding the Server Address and Port

   Before you contact your network administrator, check the appropriate EndNote connection file for the
   address of the server and the port specified.

   To obtain the server address and port:

      1. From the Tools menu, select Connection Files, and then select Open Connection Manager.

      2. Select the appropriate connection file and click Edit.

      3. In the Connection File window, click the Connection Settings panel for the server address and port.

   Depending upon the configuration of the firewall, the administrator may allow communication to all
   computers outside the firewall on the requested port, or communication to a specific server and port.

Communicating with Local Database Servers or Gateways

   Some universities and organizations license Z39.50 databases for use on their own servers, or for access
   from a local gateway. The company providing the databases will include client software for accessing the
   databases. Some Z39.50 servers are designed to respond only to requests from this client software. In other
   cases, the server must be configured to allow requests from software other than the supplied client program.

   If your organization maintains Z39.50 databases, but you are unable to connect to them with EndNote, ask
   your network administrator if the database server supports client software other than that supplied by the
   database provider.


Problems Communicating with the Host
   Once you are connected, the most common problem in communicating with a host server is a password
   problem. Check your password and user ID. Check the upper or lower case requirements. If a password is
   rejected, you will see an error message that says something like "Server has rejected initialization." See
   Access-Restricted Databases.

   The password and User ID requested by the host will generally not be your personal password and ID. It is
   usually the User ID and password assigned to your institution (the rare exception to this might be if your
   institution has a local copy of the database). These institutional User IDs and passwords are usually not
   shared with individuals within an institution. However, access may be granted to anyone connecting to the
   database from an IP address within the institution. If you are off-site and cannot access a database that you
   could access when onsite, use VPN to connect to your institution's network first, then try the connection file
   again. If you do not have VPN access to your institution's network, check with your network administrator.

   Connection files do not use the same ports that a browser uses, so they will usually not go through proxy
   servers.

   If you are still unable to connect to the database, you may be able to access it through a Web browser, then
   import the references through direct export or by saving a text file and importing the text file. See Importing
   References Downloaded from Online Databases.




       Page 617 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


The Connection Error Dialog
   When searching an online database, if there is a problem with the database, the search terms, or the
   connection file, EndNote presents an error message describing the source of the problem. The connection
   error dialog displays the original Z39.50 error message, if available, EndNote’s translated version of that
   error, and any other message being sent directly from the server. You can find details of the communication
   between EndNote and the server in the Connection Status window (select Show Connection Status from the
   Tools menu), or in the connection log. See The Connect Log File.


Problems With Retrieved Data

Blank records

   If blank records appear in your reference list, it could be due to a number of causes. One thing to check is
   whether your filter settings in the connection file match the format of the retrieved records. Open the
   connection file and view the Templates section. Also show the Connection status window (Show Connection
   Status on the Tools menu), and set its view to show Record Data. The two formats need to match in order
   for the data to import.

   Sometimes, when viewing the record data in the Connection Status window, you will notice that there is no
   bibliographic information for a reference that was retrieved. This happens sometimes where duplicate or
   blank entries remain in the online database. These can be ignored.

Asterisks in author names or titles

   For some databases, diacritical characters in the author names and titles cannot be interpreted correctly
   when EndNote retrieves the references. In such cases, the diacritical characters are replaced with an
   asterisk (*). A "quick fix" for this is to use the Find and Replace command in the Library menu to change the
   names with the asterisks to the name with the diacritical characters as they should be.

   You may be able to permanently fix the problem by changing the Text setting in the connection file to use a
   text encoding that matches the online database. Whether this will work depends on the database you are
   connecting to. Older databases may not support special characters. See The Connection Settings.

In exported references, extended characters appear as boxes

   You’ve downloaded references from an online source, and they display correctly in EndNote. But when you
   export those references to a text file, and open the file with a text reader such as NotePad, all extended
   characters (for example, umlauts) appear to be corrupted. What happened?

   Your online data source likely provided each extended character as two characters – a base letter and a
   combining character – rather than as a single, precomposed character. For example, an extended
   character can be composed of an (a) and then the combining umlaut character (¨) rather than as a single
   character (ä).

   Both character representations are perfectly valid, so initially there is no indication of a problem. Many
   applications, including EndNote and WordPad, can appropriately display extended characters in either form,
   but you happen to be using an application that cannot. Windows applications display a box character to
   indicate that the font or application cannot render the appropriate character.

   Even though the characters do not display correctly in the current application, they are still valid. Try
   opening the file with a different application.




       Page 618 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


  The adoption of Unicode has solved this problem for many modern applications. If the characters do not
  appear properly in programs you need to work with, you may also need to install a language pack that
  supports those characters. See Working with Multiple Languages.


Errors Encountered While Retrieving References
  For various reasons, some references cause errors during retrieval. If EndNote encounters an error while
  retrieving references from an online source, it stops the retrieval process. In order to get the rest of the
  references, it is best to submit the search again, and this time request the references start downloading with
  the one after the reference which might have caused an error. For example, if the error appeared while the
  tenth reference out of fifty was being retrieved, submit the search again, and when prompted, ask only for
  references 11 through 50 to be retrieved.

  EndNote typically retrieves references in batches, for speed and memory reasons. However, some servers
  are too slow, or their record data is too large, to support batch downloads. If you find that your connection
  with a service provider fails after approximately the same amount of data each time you attempt to
  download references, you can try turning off batch processing. You will need to open the connection file you
  are using, as described under Editing a Connection File, and deselect the Batch Download option described
  under The Connection Settings.

CWYW Keyboard Commands for Word
  These keyboard commands are available when you use Cite While You Write with Microsoft Word. The table
  below shows the initial settings, but you can change the key command assignments. See Keyboard
  Preferences in Microsoft Word.

  Note that:

      ▪ Alt+1 is used for both Return to Word and Go to EndNote. The program determines which
        application is currently active and switches to the other application.

      ▪ Some of these commands are available from Word and from EndNote.

      ▪ While you can change key assignments, keep in mind that most other key combinations are currently
        already in use in both EndNote and Word.

                                                                               Key

I Don't See the Correct EndNote Tab in Word
   If you see an EndNote tab with a more limited set of commands instead of an Endote 2025 tab in Microsoft
   Word, your Application preference has been changed to use an EndNote online library instead of your
   desktop library.

   Use the Application tab in the Word Cite While You Write preferences to indicate which version of EndNote
   to use when you use Cite While You Write.

       ▪ The EndNote 2025 tab is for desktop version of the EndNote application.

       ▪ The EndNote tab is for the online version of EndNote.
   To select the appropriate application:

      1. On the EndNote or EndNote 2025 tab in Word, select Preferences.

      2. Click the Application tab.

      3. Select the appropriate application: EndNote (desktop) or EndNote online.

   The system adds an EndNote 2025 tab to Word's Tabs when you select the EndNote menu option; the
   system adds an EndNote tab when you select the EndNote online menu option.

    Note: To use the EndNote online option, you must have created an EndNote account.


Bibliography Is in the Wrong Font
   When EndNote creates formatted citations and bibliographies, by default it follows the Word Normal style for
   the document in choosing fonts. However, rarely you may see a bibliography appear with an unexpected
   font. This will happen if the last paragraph for the document was set to a style other than Normal before the
   first EndNote citation was inserted.

   In a new document, there is no Word style called EndNote Bibliography or EndNote Bibliography Title, and
   no text or additional styles based on them. These Word styles appear in the document after the first
   EndNote citation is inserted and a bibliography is formatted. The EndNote Bibliography style's font will be
   based on the font used in the last paragraph mark in the document. So, if I had accidentally set the last
   paragraph in my document to use the Heading 1 style, then inserted my first EndNote citation and formatted
   the bibliography, all the references in my bibliography would be formatting with the font used for the Heading
   1 style.

   One workaround for this problem is to transfer your old document to a new one without the EndNote styles
   in it.

      1. Create a new empty document with only one line/paragraph in it, and be sure that line is set to the
         Normal style. Use the ¶ button in Word to see the paragraph marks in the document; there should be
         only one.

      2. Go back to the original document and copy everything above the bibliography from the old
         document to the new document. Be very careful not to include any of the bibliography codes when
         you copy to the new document.

      3. Paste the old text into the new document.



       Page 623 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


      4. Save the new document with a new name; do not use the name of the orginal document. You may
         still need the original document later.

      5. In the new document, on the EndNote tab, click Update Citations & Bibliography. EndNote will create
         a new bibliography at the end of the document and new EndNote styles for Word based on the
         normal style used for the last paragraph of the new document.

      6. Continue working in the new document as a replacement for the original document.

What If Other Formatting Changed?

   If you had used custom styles in your original document that did not carry over to the new document, you
   can copy them to the new document using Word's Organizer feature.

      1. Close the original document, if it is still open.

      2. Make a backup copy of your new document, just in case you run into problems.

      3. In the new document, click on the small arrow at the bottom-right corner of the Styles tab to open the
         Styles panel.

      4. Click the Manage Styles button at the bottom of the Styles panel to open the Manage Styles dialog.

      5. Click the Import/Export button at the bottom-left corner of the Manage Styles dialog to open the
         Organizer.

      6. Click the Close File button underneath the styles list shown for In Normal.dotm at the right.

      7. Click the Open File button at the right, locate and open your original document. You should now see
         the list of styles used in your original document on the right side.

      8. Select the styles you want to use from your original document at the right and click the Copy button,
         then confirm the choice to copy the styles. This will copy those styles to the new document, which
         should be showing at the left. Be careful not to copy any style starting with "EndNote."

      9. Close the Organizer.

   You should now see the same formatting you had for your original document for any styles your copied.


Garbled ADDIN EN.CITE Code
   When you insert a citation into a Word document, the citation is embedded in field codes, such as:




       Page 624 of 631
       Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide




   Field codes hold reference information for your formatted citations, and are typically hidden. See Field
   Codes in Microsoft Word for more information on field codes.

   To hide field codes in Word:

      1. In Word, select Options from the File menu.

      2. Click Advanced.

      3. Scroll to the Show document content section and clear the box titled Show field codes instead of
         their values.

      4. Click OK.

   Your citations will now appear correct in the document. Field codes are still there, and are necessary, but
   they are hidden from view.

    Note: An easy way to turn field codes on or off is to press Alt+F9.



Inserted Citations Disappear, but Reference List is Created
   Most likely, you are formatting with a footnote output style that doesn't include a citation definition, such as
   the Chicago 18th Footnote style. To fix this, format the bibliography with a style that uses in-text citations
   instead of footnotes.

   To reformat with a different output style:

      1. On the EndNote 2025 tab in Word, click the small arrow at the bottom corner of the Bibliography
         group.

          In OpenOffice Writer, select Format Bibliography from the EndNote menu.



       Page 625 of 631
      Clarivate EndNote 2025 User Help Guide


     2. In the drop-down output style list, select the output style you would like to use. Click the Browse
        button to choose from the list of installed styles. (To add styles, see Installing Additional Output
        Styles.)

     3. Click OK to format the document using the selected style.

  If you are using an author/year type of output style, and the reference you are citing does not include an
  author or a year, there will be nothing to display in the citation. The citation will not show up, although the full
  form will appear in the reference list at the end of the document.


Word Crashes or Gives an Error When Inserting a Large Number of
Citations
  EndNote uses Word's hidden field codes when formatting citations, and inserts all the reference information
  for all of the grouped citations in these codes. However, there is a limit to the amount of text that Microsoft
  allows in a single set of field codes. You may reach the maximum limit when you attempt to insert 20 or
  more references into a single grouped citation that have extensive information in them (such as large
  abstracts).

  To avoid this issue, try not to insert a large group of citations all at once. Instead, insert a small group of
  references, then a space, and then insert another small group of references. This avoids having a single
  group of formatted citations that would exceed Word's field code limitations. When the document is finished,
  you can create a copy of the document with field codes removed and manually adjust the reference to
  remove the spaces. See Removing Field Codes.

  Another option is to reduce the amount of text that would be in the field codes by editing the reference(s) to
  remove unnecessary notes or text. For extremely large abstracts, consider moving the abstract to a Word
  document or other text file and attaching that file to the reference. Almost any type of file can be attached to
  an EndNote record, not just PDFs. Attachments are not included in field codes.

  When you use Insert Selected Citations, or highlight multiple citations to insert from the Find Citations
  dialog, EndNote limits you to 250 citations in a single group.
