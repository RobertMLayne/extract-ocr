# Agent notes (extract-ocr)

- Prefer modifying existing scripts over introducing new frameworks.
- Validate changes by running the closest VS Code task when possible.
- Keep changes scoped: exporter logic, robustness, and output quality.
- Avoid copying third-party documentation text into new committed files.
